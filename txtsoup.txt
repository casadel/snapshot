biocryst announces results from opus-2   research triangle park, n.c., feb. 08, 2016 (globe newswire) -- biocryst pharmaceuticals, inc., (nasdaq:bcrx) today announced results from opus-2 (oral prophylaxis-2), a clinical trial of avoralstat administered three times daily as a liquid-filled soft gel formulation for the prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema (hae) attacks.   in the opus-2 study, hae patients with a historical attack frequency of greater than 0.45 attacks per week were randomized to treatment with either 500 mg or 300 mg of avoralstat, or placebo, administered three times daily for 12 weeks.  the primary goals of the trial were to characterize the efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks, and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of avoralstat treatment. the primary efficacy endpoint was angioedema attack frequency.   thirty-eight subjects received avoralstat 500 mg, 36 subjects received avoralstat 300 mg, and 36 subjects received placebo.  treatment with 500 mg and 300 mg of avoralstat three times daily failed to demonstrate a statistically significantly lower mean attack rate versus placebo.  the mean (standard deviation) attack rates per week were 0.63 (0.57) on avoralstat 500mg, 0.71 (0.66) on avoralstat 300mg, compared to 0.61 (0.41) on placebo.   "opus-2 was a well-designed and executed trial that gave us a clear answer; this dosage form of avoralstat is not a viable formulation to move forward," said jon p. stonehouse, president & chief executive officer.  "while we are disappointed in the study results, we learned that meaningfully better exposure is needed for avoralstat to succeed. we expect results from a relative bioavailability study testing a novel solid dosage form of avoralstat by mid-year -- the primary goals of this study are to achieve much higher exposures and twice daily dosing. our other opportunity to achieve higher exposure of an oral kallikrein inhibitor is with bcx7353 - we expect results from the bcx7353 apex-1 dose ranging study in hae patients by year end."   secondary efficacy endpoints included measures of quality of life, attack duration and attack severity. statistically significant improvements in duration of attacks and in the angioedema quality of life total score, and its domains, were observed comparing the 500 mg three times a day avoralstat arm to placebo.   oral administration of avoralstat in opus-2 was generally safe and well tolerated; the adverse event profile was similar to that for placebo; and no safety signals were observed.   conference call and web cast   biocryst's management team will host a conference call and webcast today, february 8, 2016 at 8:00 a.m. eastern time, to discuss the results of the opus-2 trial and other aspects of biocryst's hae development program.  to participate in the conference call, please dial 1-877-303-8027 (united states) or 1-760-536-5165 (international).  no passcode is needed for the call.  the webcast can be accessed by logging onto http://www.biocryst.com. please connect to the web site at least 15 minutes prior to the start of the conference call to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be necessary.   about avoralstat   discovered by biocryst, avoralstat is a novel, selective inhibitor of plasma kallikrein in development for prevention of attacks in patients with hereditary angioedema (hae). by inhibiting plasma kallikrein, avoralstat suppresses bradykinin production. bradykinin is the mediator of acute swelling attacks in hae patients.   about hereditary angioedema   hae is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people. hae symptoms include recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet, face, genitalia and airway. in addition, patients often have bouts of excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that are caused by swelling in the intestinal wall. airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can lead to death by asphyxiation. further information regarding hae can be found at www.haea.org.   about biocryst pharmaceuticals   biocryst pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small molecule drugs that block key enzymes involved in rare diseases. biocryst's ongoing development programs include oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for hereditary angioedema; avoralstat, bcx7353 and other second generation compounds, and bcx4430, a broad spectrum viral rna polymerase inhibitor. for more information, please visit the company's website at www.biocryst.com.

novan announces statistically significant phase2 clinical trial results for sb206   number of patients with complete clearance of genital warts provides clinical evidence of nitric oxide anti-viral activity against hpv   company plans end-of-phase2 meeting for first half of 2017   morrisville, n.c., nov. 29, 2016 (globe newswire) -- novan, inc. ("the company" or "novan") (nasdaq:novn) today announced topline results from the company's phase2 clinical trial with sb206 for the treatment of genital warts caused by human papillomavirus, or hpv. the highest dose tested, sb206 12%, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in the incidence of complete clearance of all baseline warts compared to vehicle treatment after 12 weeks in both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol analyses.   "these data are impressive. the magnitude of effect with favorable tolerability provides us great enthusiasm for patients suffering from the most common sexually transmitted infection in the united states," said nathan stasko, phd, president and chief executive officer of novan. "importantly, sb206 represents another drug candidate from our platform that has now shown the repeatability of taking a fundamental nitric oxide mechanism of action, generating compelling preclinical evidence and then translating that success into statistically significant results in phase2 clinical trials. genital warts was our first viral target, and as we develop sb206 further we intend to diligently investigate the numerous other viral skin infections in need of new treatment options."   in this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial, the safety and efficacy of sb206 was evaluated in 107 patients with external genital warts and perianal warts. the dose and dosing frequency of sb206 was tested in four independent cohorts in which patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either sb206 or vehicle and treated for up to 12 weeks. sb206 doses included sb206 4% twice-daily, 4% once-daily, 8% once-daily and the highest dose evaluated, 12% once-daily. patients eligible for this clinical trial were males or females, 18 to 50 years of age, with 2 to 20 warts on the genital or perianal area. the mean wart count burden per patient at baseline was 7.4 warts.   the primary endpoint for this clinical trial was the proportion of patients who were completely clear of warts that were present at baseline at or before week 12. in the intent-to-treat analysis, 33% of patients achieved complete clearance of all warts by week 12 when treated with sb206 12% once-daily, compared to only 4% of patients achieving complete clearance with vehicle once-daily (p=0.0099). in the per-protocol analysis containing patients who completed a full 12 weeks of dosing, 42% of patients achieved complete clearance of all warts when treated with sb206 12% once-daily, compared to only 7% of patients achieving complete clearance with vehicle once-daily (p=0.0200).   the cutaneous tolerability of sb206 was carefully monitored and recorded using scores on a four-point grading scale for erythema, edema, erosions or ulcers and burning or stinging. the once-daily treatment arms were generally well tolerated, including the most effective dose, 12% once-daily. the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were application site reactions, the percentage of which was highest in patients treated with sb206 4% twice-daily. based on the local application site adverse-event profile and the company's strict, pre-specified stopping criteria, sb206 4% twice-daily was discontinued, and all of the remaining cohorts were dosed once-daily.   "i am honored to be part of the sb206 investigative team, and it was exciting to observe the clinical benefits that a number of my patients experienced during the phase2 trial," said dr. valentin almendarez, jr., board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist at the institute for women's health in san antonio. "i believe that novan's topical nitric oxide-releasing gel, sb206, could be a valuable treatment alternative to existing prescription therapies and locally destructive procedures, with a mechanism of action that would be truly groundbreaking for the treatment of viral infections if approved."   "our sb206 development program now includes in vitro evidence against high-risk hpv-18 in a human raft cell culture model, in vivo data against papilloma virus in rabbits, and clinical evidence from our phase2 trial against genital warts commonly caused by hpv-6 and -11," said dr. m. joyce rico, board-certified dermatologist and chief medical officer of novan. "the ability to directly inhibit viral replication suggests that our nitric oxide-releasing technology may demonstrate activity against a broad spectrum of hpv strains, including high-risk subtypes associated with cancers of the head, neck and cervix."   based on the data generated in this phase2 dose-ranging trial, novan expects to discuss the entirety of the sb206 development program with the us food and drug administration, or fda, in the first half of 2017 and, assuming a successful end-of-phase2 meeting with the fda, plans to initiate the company's late-stage program with phase3 pivotal clinical trials of sb206 in the second half of 2017.   about human papillomavirus (hpv) and genital warts   hpv refers to a large family of double-stranded dna viruses that induce abnormal growths on the skin or mucosal surfaces. hpv affects nearly 80 million americans, and an estimated 14 million new cases of the virus are reported each year, according to the centers for disease control and prevention, or cdc. there are over 100 subtypes of the virus, characterized as low-risk or high-risk based on their cancer-causing potential. the virus is typically transmitted via direct skin-to-skin contact through disruptions in the normal skin barrier. all warts are caused by hpv, including genital and perianal warts, common warts and plantar warts.   genital warts are among the world's most common sexually transmitted diseases. genital warts are usually flesh-colored growths that can be raised, flat or cauliflower-shaped and are typically found on the surface of the external genitalia or in and around the anus. in males, they can appear on the surface of the penis and scrotum, and in females inside the vagina or on the cervix. genital warts carry a substantial psychosocial burden due to the shame and embarrassment related to having a sexually transmitted disease as well as the inconvenience and discomfort of current treatment modalities. current treatment options for genital warts consist of ablative procedures that cut, burn or freeze the warts but do not address the underlying viral infection, and there are no currently approved oral or topical prescription products indicated for the treatment of genital warts with a direct anti-viral mechanism of action.   about novan   novan, inc. is a late-stage pharmaceutical company focused on redefining the standard of care in dermatology through the development and commercialization of innovative therapies using the company's nitric oxide-releasing platform. nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated, first-in-class product candidates. we are rapidly advancing programs in five dermatological conditions with significant unmet medical need. we believe that our ability to conveniently deploy nitric oxide on demand in topical formulations allows us the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes in a variety of skin diseases and positions us to be a commercially successful leader in the dermatology market.   for more information, visit the company's website at www.novan.com.   forward-looking statements   this press release contains forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements related to pharmaceutical development of nitric oxide-releasing product candidates and future prospects. forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations, including, but not limited to, uncertainties and risks in the clinical development process, including, among others, length, expense, ability to enroll patients, reliance on third parties, and that results of earlier research and preclinical or clinical trials may not be predictive of results, conclusions or interpretations of later research or trials; whether we will be able to obtain additional funding when needed; and other risks and uncertainties described in our prospectus dated sept. 20, 2016, filed with the securities and exchange commission (the "sec"), in our quarterly report filed with the sec on form 10-q for the three months ended sept. 30, 2016, and in any subsequent filings with the sec. these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release, and novan disclaims any intent or obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements, except as may be required by law.
lexicon reports topline results from phase2 clinical trial conducted in collaboration with jdrf   study conducted in young adults with type 1 diabetes and high baseline a1c   pr newswire   the woodlands, texas, dec. 5, 2016   the woodlands, texas, dec. 5, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- lexicon pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: lxrx) announced topline results today from a phase2 clinical study of sotagliflozin, a dual sglt1 and sglt2 inhibitor, conducted by lexicon in collaboration with jdrf, the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes research.   the purpose of this phase2 clinical trial, which randomized a total of 87 patients, was to assess the effects of a once-daily 400 mg dose of sotagliflozin compared to a placebo control in insulin-treated young adults with type 1 diabetes, aged 18-30 years, and particularly high baseline a1c levels of greater than or equal to 9.0%, representative of an at-risk population in which glycemic control and adherence to therapy are substantial challenges.  the study promoted adherence and encouraged insulin austment as needed to achieve glucose control targets.   patients treated with sotagliflozin as an aunct to insulin had a mean reduction from baseline in a1c of 1.33% after 12 weeks of treatment.  the results for the a1c primary endpoint numerically favored sotagliflozin, with a placebo-austed reduction of 0.35%, but did not reach statistical significance.  a pre-planned subgroup analysis in patients with a1c at baseline of less than or equal to 10.0% showed a statistically-significant reduction in this same a1c primary endpoint, with sotagliflozin-treated patients achieving a mean reduction from baseline in a1c of 1.43% and a placebo-austed reduction of 0.75% (p=0.006).  in secondary measures:    -- patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved an increase of approximately       one-third in the mean proportion of time spent in the target range of       70-180 mg/dl (from 33.1% at baseline to 43.6% at week 12) as measured by        continuous glucose monitoring (cgm), as compared to a slight reduction in       time in the target range (from 33.5% at baseline to 32.9% at week 12) for       patients treated with placebo.     -- patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean placebo-austed       reduction from baseline to week 12 of 56.6 mg/dl in two-hour       post-prandial glucose (ppg) following a standardized mixed meal.     -- patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean reduction of 0.62 kg        in body weight from baseline to week 12, as compared to an increase of       1.75 kg in body weight for patients treated with placebo.   sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the study, with a smaller proportion of patients on sotagliflozin experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events (aes) (58.1% on sotagliflozin vs. 61.9% on placebo) and serious aes (saes) (4.7% on sotagliflozin vs. 7.1% on placebo).  there were no discontinuations from study drug due to aes on sotagliflozin vs. two patients on placebo. one patient in the sotagliflozin treated arm and two patients in the placebo arm experienced a severe hypoglycemia event during the 12-week treatment period.  no patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) event, whereas one placebo-treated patient experienced a dka event during the 12-week treatment period and two additional patients experienced a dka event during the pre-randomization, placebo run-in period of the study.  there were no deaths in the study.   "sotagliflozin demonstrated favorable safety in this study in an at-risk population and continues to show evidence of improvements in the quality of glucose control consistent with its mechanism of action," said pablo lapuerta, m.d., lexicon's executive vice president and chief medical officer. "reductions in post-prandial glucose were consistent with sglt1 inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract.  better control of post-prandial glucose will allow patients with type 1 diabetes to spend more time with glucose in a better range, with low rates of severe hypoglycemia."   "we applaud the efforts of lexicon in prioritizing the development of novel therapies for the multitudes affected by type 1 diabetes.  individuals with type 1 diabetes continue to experience challenges of disease burden and high levels of a1c, and we expect at least a subset of those to benefit from novel, add-on therapies to elicit additional glycemic and metabolic benefits," said sanjoy dutta, ph.d., associate vice president, translational development and international partnerships at jdrf.  "we are looking forward to seeing new options for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we truly value our partnership with lexicon as we drive our vision of a world without type 1 diabetes."   about the jdrf phase2 clinical trial   the double-blind, placebo controlled, phase2 study randomized 87 patients, aged 18 to 30, in the united states with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an a1c level entering the study greater than or equal to 9.0%.  the study evaluated a once-daily 400 mg dose of sotagliflozin, before the first meal of the day, against placebo.  prior to randomization, there was a two-week run-in period in which patients received placebo in addition to insulin.  after completion of the run-in period, patients were randomized to either sotagliflozin or placebo.  the mean a1c level at baseline, after the two-week run-in period, was 9.9% in the sotagliflozin-treated arm and 9.7% in the placebo arm.  following randomization, austments in insulin doses were made when needed in the medical judgment of the investigator.  during the 12-week treatment period, total insulin use increased in the placebo arm and decreased in the sotagliflozin arm; basal insulin use increased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater increase in the placebo arm; and bolus insulin use decreased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater decrease in the sotagliflozin arm.   about sotagliflozin   discovered using lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (sglt1 and sglt2). sglt1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and sglt2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney.   lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi in november 2015 under which lexicon granted sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin.  lexicon is responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the united states.  sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the united states.   lexicon announced positive topline results of its first pivotal phase3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes, on a background of optimized insulin (intandem1), in september 2016.  lexicon is conducting a second pivotal phase3 clinical trial (intandem2) from which topline results are expected later this month.  a third type 1 diabetes phase3 clinical trial, intandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization.  sanofi is expected to commence phase3 clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes this year.   about lexicon   lexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on nobel prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions. through its genome5000(tm) program, lexicon scientists have studied the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes over the last 20 years and have identified more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a range of diseases. through the precise targeting of these proteins, lexicon is pioneering the discovery and development of innovative medicines to safely and effectively treat disease. lexicon has a pipeline of promising drug candidates in clinical and pre-clinical development in oncology, diabetes and metabolism. for additional information please visit www.lexpharma.com.   about jdrf   jdrf is the leading global organization funding type 1 diabetes (t1d) research. jdrf's mission is to accelerate life-changing breakthroughs to cure, prevent and treat t1d and its complications. to accomplish this, jdrf has invested nearly $2 billion in research funding since its inception. jdrf is an organization built on a grassroots model of people connecting in their local communities, collaborating regionally for efficiency and broader fundraising impact, and uniting on a national stage to pool resources, passion, and energy. jdrf collaborates with academic institutions, policymakers, and corporate and industry partners to develop and deliver a pipeline of innovative therapies to people living with t1d. jdrf's staff and volunteers throughout the united states and its six international affiliates are dedicated to advocacy, community engagement and its vision of a world without t1d. for more information, please visit jdrf.org or follow us on twitter: @jdrf.

(nasdaq:atra) today announced results from its phase2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for pinta 745 for the treatment of protein energy wasting (pew) in patients with end stage renal disease (esrd). the trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from baseline in lean body mass (lbm) as measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (dxa) at week 12 following weekly treatment with pinta 745.   pinta 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic control and markers of inflammation. there were no treatment related serious adverse events observed in the trial.   "we are very disappointed that pinta 745 did not meet the primary endpoint of this phase2 clinical trial. these data are unambiguous and contrast with prior clinical and preclinical results," said isaac ciechanover, m.d. president and chief executive officer of atara bio. "we want to sincerely thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this trial."     as a consequence of these results, atara bio will suspend further development of pinta 745. to date, third-party direct costs for the development of pinta 745 from our inception through the third quarter of 2015 were approximately $10 million.   the company will focus its resources on its portfolio of clinical stage oncology and immunotherapy product candidates, including:    -- epstein-barr virus (ebv) targeted cytotoxic t-lymphocyte (ebv-ctl), which       received breakthrough designation in rituximab refractory ebv associated         post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic       hematopoietic cell transplant (allohct) and is in two ongoing phase2       trials for ebv malignancies;      -- cytomegalovirus (cmv) targeted cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (cmv-ctl), which       is in two phase2 clinical trials for refractory cmv infections that       occur in patients who have received an allohct;      -- wilms' tumor 1 targeted cytotoxic t-lymphocytes (wt1-ctl), which is in       two ongoing phase1 clinical trials assessing safety and initial       anti-tumor efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies; and      -- stm 434, an activin inhibitor, which is in an ongoing phase1 clinical       trial assessing safety and initial anti-tumor efficacy in patients with       ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors.   atara ended the third quarter of 2015 with approximately $334.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments, providing sufficient resources to further advance the company's oncology and immunotherapy portfolio, including completion of the ongoing clinical studies and the planned initiation of two pivotal trials for ebv-ctl.   conference call information   members of the atara bio management team will host a live conference call and webcast today, december 14, 2015 at 8:00 a.m. eastern time. the live webcast can be accessed by visiting the investor relations section of the atara bio's website at www.atarabio.com. please connect 15 minutes prior to the live webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be needed to access the webcast. alternatively, please call 866-416-1813 (us) or 704-908-0390 (international) to listen to the conference call. the conference id number for the live call will be 5510030. an archive of the webcast will be available on the investor relations section of the atara bio's website for 14 days.   about atara biotherapeutics, inc.   atara biotherapeutics, inc. is a biopharmaceutical company developing meaningful therapies for patients with unmet medical needs in diseases that have seen limited therapeutic innovation, with an initial focus on immunotherapy and oncology. atara bio's programs include t-cell product candidates and molecularly targeted product candidates. the t-cell product candidates include ebv-ctl, cmv-ctl and wt1-ctl and harness the power of the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells and cells infected with certain viruses. the molecularly targeted product candidates include stm 434 and ata 842. these product candidates target activin and myostatin, members of the tgf-beta family of proteins, and have demonstrated the potential to have therapeutic benefit in a number of clinical indications.
alkermes announces topline results of forward-3 and forward-4, two phase3 studies of alks 5461 in major depressive disorder   -- neither study met primary endpoint; additional analyses of forward-4 provide supportive evidence of efficacy --   -- third efficacy study, forward-5, will recruit additional patients; data may provide regulatory path forward for alks 5461 -- dublin--(business wire)--january 21, 2016--   alkermes plc (nasdaq: alks) today announced preliminary topline results from forward-3 and forward-4, the first two of three phase3 efficacy studies to read out from the comprehensive forward pivotal program for alks 5461, a once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action for the aunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd) in patients who have an inadequate response to standard therapies for clinical depression. neither of the two studies met the prespecified primary efficacy endpoint, which compared alks 5461 to placebo on the change from baseline on the montgomery--&#197;sberg depression rating scale (madrs).   forward-4 tested two dose levels of alks 5461 (2mg/2mg and 0.5mg/0.5mg) compared to placebo. 385 patients entered the study. there was a clear trend toward efficacy with the 2mg/2mg dose of alks 5461 on the primary endpoint, and post hoc analyses achieved statistical significance for the entire 2mg/2mg dose group on the madrs endpoint. based on these analyses, alkermes believes that forward-4 provides supportive evidence of the efficacy of alks 5461 in the treatment of major depressive disorder.   forward-3 tested alks 5461 (2mg/2mg) compared to placebo. 429 patients entered the study. placebo response was greater than that observed in forward-4 and no treatment effect of alks 5461 was observed. negative trials due to significant placebo effect are not uncommon in the study of major depressive disorder.   forward-5, the third pivotal efficacy study in the forward program, is ongoing, testing two dose levels of alks 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg). forward-5 shares common design and analysis features with forward-4. based on information gained from forward-3 and forward-4, patient enrollment in forward-5 will be increased and the statistical analysis plan will be updated. alkermes will provide an update later this quarter on the projected timing of completion of forward-5.   in the case of a clear positive outcome for forward-5, alkermes believes that the evidence provided by it and the previously completed successful, randomized, placebo-controlled phase2 study, together with supportive evidence from forward-4, collectively could provide substantial evidence of efficacy for alks 5461 for the aunctive treatment of mdd. in that case, alkermes would request a meeting with the us food and drug administration's (fda) division of psychiatric products to discuss the regulatory path for this fast track designated medicine.   "we are gaining important insights as we proceed with the forward program for alks 5461. the third pivotal efficacy study, forward-5, is ongoing and we plan to adapt it to incorporate findings from forward-3 and forward-4," stated elliot ehrich, m.d., chief medical officer of alkermes. "clinical trials of new medicines for the treatment of major depressive disorder are complicated by significant placebo response. we designed the forward pivotal program to include three efficacy studies as we recognize that this is a challenging disease state where multiple clinical studies and expansive analyses are generally necessary to confirm the efficacy of a new medicine."    "we are steadfast in our commitment to developing new medicines for serious cns conditions where there is a clear and compelling need for new treatment options for patients and their families," said richard pops, chief executive officer of alkermes. "major depressive disorder is one of these conditions. we are building a large body of evidence supporting our belief in the clinical utility and the novel mechanism of action of alks 5461. we await the results of forward-5 and will determine our next steps along the regulatory path with those results in hand."   in forward-3, the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, headache and fatigue, and in forward-4 they were nausea, headache and dizziness. the safety and tolerability profile of alks 5461 was consistent with that reported for the phase2 and forward-1 studies.   about forward-3 and forward-4   forward-3 and forward-4 are phase3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of once-daily alks 5461 as aunctive treatment in patients with mdd who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri). the prespecified primary endpoint of both studies was the change from baseline in madrs scores. all participants in the double-blind portion of the study were eligible to continue in an open-label phase and receive alks 5461 for an additional 12 months.   about the phase3 forward clinical program   the forward (focused on results with a rethinking of depression) pivotal program for alks 5461 includes three core phase3 efficacy studies, as well as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing, pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of alks 5461. the primary efficacy endpoint for the three core efficacy studies is the change from baseline in montgomery--&#197;sberg depression rating scale (madrs) scores.   further information about the forward studies can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.   about alks 5461   alks 5461 is a proprietary, oral investigational medicine that acts as a balanced neuromodulator in the brain and represents a novel mechanism of action for treating mdd. alks 5461 consists of samidorphan and buprenorphine, and is designed to rebalance brain function that is dysregulated in the state of depression. in october 2013, the fda granted fast track status for alks 5461 for the aunctive treatment of mdd in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.   about mdd   according to the dsm-5(r)  (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition), major depressive disorder (mdd) is a condition in which patients exhibit depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a two-week period, and demonstrate impaired social, occupational, educational or other important functioning. an estimated 17 million people in the us suffer from mdd in a given year, (1,2)  the majority of whom may not adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy.(3)   about alkermes   alkermes plc is a fully integrated, global biopharmaceutical company developing innovative medicines for the treatment of central nervous system (cns) diseases. the company has a diversified commercial product portfolio and a substantial clinical pipeline of product candidates for chronic diseases that include schizophrenia, depression, addiction and multiple sclerosis. headquartered in dublin, ireland, alkermes plc has an r&d center in waltham, massachusetts; a research and manufacturing facility in athlone, ireland; and a manufacturing facility in wilmington, ohio. for more information, please visit alkermes' website at www.alkermes.com. 
 february 16, 2016 21:05:00 utc pivotal phase3 trials to use placebo as comparator  first phase3 clinical trial expected to commence in third quarter of 2016  ocular therapeutix, inc. (nasdaq:ocul), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced the phase3 clinical development strategy for its otx-tp (sustained release travoprost) drug product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. based on feedback from a recent meeting with the us food and drug administration (fda), ocular therapeutix intends to commence the first of two planned phase3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016.  the planned trial design for the two phase3 clinical trials includes an otx-tp treatment arm and a placebo-controlled comparator arm that would use a non-drug eluting hydrogel-based intracanalicular depot. the company does not expect that a timolol comparator or validation arm will be required in the study design and does not expect that eye drops, placebo or active, will be administered in either arm. the company expects that the fda will require that otx-tp show a statistically superior and clinically meaningful reduction of intraocular pressure (iop), compared to the placebo, as a primary efficacy endpoint.  “we are pleased with the outcome of our recent meeting with the fda to discuss the phase3 clinical development plan for otx-tp. we believe that a direct comparison of otx-tp with a placebo comparator reflects the simplest and most real world appropriate clinical study design for this product,” said amar sawhney, ph.d., president, chief executive officer and chairman. “this meeting was an important milestone for advancing this program into the next stage of its development. we expect to initiate the first of two planned phase3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016 after holding an end of phase2 meeting with the fda and finalizing the protocol for the trials.”  robert noecker, md, mba, ophthalmic consultants of connecticut, and assistant clinical professor, yale university school of medicine, stated, “compliance remains a major issue with all current glaucoma eye drop therapies. sustained release drug candidates such as otx-tp address this issue directly, and have the potential to put the control back into the hands of the physician by removing the burden on the patient to administer eye drops every single day. in clinical trials to date, otx-tp has shown a clinically meaningful iop lowering effect and has not caused hyperemia, or eye redness, a common side effect of topical glaucoma therapies. it offers a preservative-free formulation that appears to be benign to the ocular surface, which can be adversely affected by preservatives used in eye drops for chronic glaucoma therapy. otx-tp is a product candidate that may offer an important advancement in the treatment of glaucoma.”  about glaucoma and ocular hypertension  glaucoma and ocular hypertension are chronic, sight-threatening diseases in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which may result in irreversible vision loss. glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. ocular hypertension is characterized by elevated levels of intraocular pressure without any optic nerve damage. patients with ocular hypertension are at high risk of developing glaucoma. in the us alone 2.7 million people suffer from glaucoma. according to ims health data, there were 33 million prescriptions and sales of over $2.4 billion of drugs administered by eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma in 2014.  about sustained release travoprost  sustained release travoprost (otx-tp) is a preservative-free drug product candidate that resides within the canaliculus and delivers the prostaglandin analog travoprost to the ocular surface for up to 90 days. the drug depot is designed to deliver a continuous steady release throughout the treatment period. a fluorescent visualization aid is formulated within the product to enable both the physician and the patient to monitor drug presence throughout the course of therapy.  about ocular therapeutix, inc.  ocular therapeutix, inc. (nasdaq: ocul) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using its proprietary hydrogel platform technology. ocular therapeutix's lead product candidate, dextenza™, is in phase3 clinical development for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain and allergic conjunctivitis, and in phase2 clinical development for inflammatory dry eye disease. an nda for the post-operative ocular pain indication has been accepted by the fda with a pdufa date of july 24, 2016. a third phase3 clinical trial is being conducted for post-operative ocular inflammation and pain. for glaucoma and ocular hypertension, otx-tp (sustained release travoprost) intracanalicular depot, has completed a phase2b clinical trial. ocular therapeutix is also evaluating sustained-release injectable anti-vegf drug depots for back-of-the-eye diseases. ocular therapeutix's first product, resure® sealant, is fda-approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery.
gw pharmaceuticals announces positive phase3 pivotal study results for epidiolex(r) (cannabidiol)   - study in the treatment of dravet syndrome -- a rare and severe form of epilepsy in children with no fda-approved treatments -   - primary endpoint achieved with high statistical significance (p=0.01) showing that epidiolex treatment reduces convulsive seizures in children compared to placebo -   - company to hold investor conference call today at 8:00 a.m. edt/12:00 noon gmt -   london, march 14, 2016 (globe newswire) -- gw pharmaceuticals plc (nasdaq:gwph) (aim:gwp) ("gw," "the company" or "the group"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, announces the positive results of the first pivotal phase3 study of its investigational medicine epidiolex(r) (cannabidiol or cbd) for the treatment of dravet syndrome. in this study, epidiolex achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in convulsive seizures assessed over the entire treatment period compared with placebo (p=0.01). epidiolex has both orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the us food and drug administration (fda) in the treatment of dravet syndrome, a rare and debilitating type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments approved in the us   "the results of this epidiolex pivotal trial are important and exciting as they represent the first placebo-controlled evidence to support the safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabidiol in children with dravet syndrome, one of the most severe and difficult-to-treat types of epilepsy," said orrin devinsky, m.d., of new york university langone medical center's comprehensive epilepsy center. "these data demonstrate that epidiolex delivers clinically important reductions in seizure frequency together with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, providing the epilepsy community with the prospect of an appropriately standardized and tested pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol being made available by prescription in the future."   "the positive outcome of this phase3 trial is a significant milestone in the development of epidiolex as a potential new treatment for patients suffering from dravet syndrome. we are excited about the potential for epidiolex to become the first fda approved treatment option specifically for dravet syndrome patients and their families," stated justin gover, gw's chief executive officer. "in light of this positive data, we will now request a pre-nda meeting with the fda to discuss our proposed regulatory submission. we also look forward with excitement to the upcoming results from the two phase3 trials in lennox-gastaut syndrome and the second pivotal trial in dravet syndrome."   "dravet syndrome is one of the most catastrophic types of epilepsy in children and safe and effective treatments are desperately needed. we are thrilled to learn of these positive results, which bring much needed hope to the children and families who have been living with these debilitating seizures," said mary anne meskis, executive director of the dravet syndrome foundation.   study overview   the phase3 study randomized 120 patients into two arms, epidiolex 20mg/kg/day (n=61) and placebo (n=59). epidiolex or placebo was added to current anti-epileptic drug (aed) treatment regimens. on average, patients were taking approximately 3 aeds, having previously tried and failed an average of more than 4 other aeds. the average age of trial participants was 10 years and 30 percent of patients were less than 6 years of age. the median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per month was 13.   the primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between epidiolex and placebo measuring the percentage change in the monthly frequency of convulsive seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation period. in this study, patients taking epidiolex achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of 39 percent compared with a reduction on placebo of 13 percent, which was highly statistically significant (p=0.01). a series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint confirmed the robustness of this result. the difference between epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the entire treatment period.   results from secondary efficacy endpoints reinforced the overall effectiveness observed with epidiolex.   epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this study. the most common adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of epidiolex-treated patients) were: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, pyrexia, vomiting, lethargy, upper respiratory tract infection and convulsion.  of those patients on epidiolex that reported an adverse event, 84 percent reported it to be mild or moderate. ten patients on epidiolex experienced a serious adverse event compared with three patients on placebo. eight patients on epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared with one patient on placebo.   further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.   in addition to this first phase3 trial, gw is conducting a second phase3 trial in dravet syndrome which is recruiting 150 patients.   gw clinical trial programs in lennox-gastaut syndrome and tuberous sclerosis complex   in addition to the dravet syndrome trials, gw is conducting the largest global pivotal clinical trial program to date in lennox-gastaut syndrome, another rare and severe form of epilepsy. the first phase3 trial is a placebo-controlled trial of epidiolex (at a dose of 20 mg/kg) over a 14-week treatment period and has randomized 171 patients. this trial is expected to report topline results in the second quarter of 2016. the second placebo-controlled trial has randomized a total of 225 patients and is expected to report topline results mid-2016. the primary measure of efficacy in these two trials will be the comparison between epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in number of monthly drop seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation period.   based on the findings of the physician-led expanded access program, gw continues to identify additional development targets for epidiolex within the field of childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. a phase3 trial in a third epilepsy indication, tuberous sclerosis complex, is due to commence imminently and clinical development in a fourth indication is expected to commence in the second half of 2016.   investor conference call and webcast information   gw pharmaceuticals will host a conference call and webcast for analysts and investors to discuss the results from this initial phase3 study today at 8:00 a.m. edt /12:00 noon gmt. to participate in the conference call, please dial 877-407-8133 (toll free from the us and canada), or 0800-756-3429 (toll free from the uk) or 201-689-8040 (international). investors may also access a live audio webcast of the call via the investor relations section of the company's website at http://www.gwpharm.com. a replay of the call will also be available through the gw website shortly after the call and will remain available for 90 days. replay numbers: (toll free): 1-877-660-6853, (international): 1-201-612-7415. for both dial-in numbers please use conference id # 13632627.   about dravet syndrome   dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset and highly treatment-resistant epileptic syndrome frequently associated with a genetic mutation in sodium channels. onset of dravet syndrome occurs during the first year of life in previously healthy and developmentally normal infants. initial seizures are often temperature related, severe, and long-lasting. over time, people with dravet syndrome can develop multiple types of seizures, including tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atypical absences and are prone to bouts of prolonged seizures called status epilepticus, which can be life threatening. risk of premature death including sudep (sudden expected death in epilepsy) is elevated in people with dravet syndrome. additionally, the majority will develop moderate to severe intellectual and development disabilities and require lifelong supervision and care. there are currently no fda-approved treatments and nearly all patients continue to have uncontrolled seizures and other medical needs throughout their lifetime.   about epidiolex (cannabidiol)   epidiolex, gw's lead cannabinoid product candidate, is a liquid formulation of pure plant-derived cbd, which is in development for the treatment of a number of rare childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. gw has conducted extensive pre-clinical research of cbd in epilepsy since 2007. this research has shown that cbd has significant anti-epileptiform and anticonvulsant activity using a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and has the ability to treat seizures in acute animal models of epilepsy with significantly fewer side effects than existing anti-epileptic drugs. to date, gw has received orphan drug designation from the fda for epidiolex in the treatment of both dravet syndrome and lennox-gastaut syndrome. additionally, gw has received fast track designation from the fda and orphan designation from the european medicines agency for epidiolex for the treatment of dravet syndrome. gw is currently evaluating additional clinical development programs in other orphan seizure disorders. 
apricus reports topline phase2b data for fispemifene in symptomatic secondary hypogonadism   fispemifene failed to achieve statistical significance in key clinical benefit endpoints despite increase in testosterone levels   company will focus on internal pipeline, including expanding market share for vitaros(r) in europe and nda re-submission in the us in q3 2016   conference call / webcast today, monday, march 28, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. et   san diego, march 28, 2016 (globe newswire) -- apricus biosciences, inc. (nasdaq:apri), a biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative medicines in urology and rheumatology, today announced topline results from the phase2b proof-of-concept study of fispemifene in men with secondary hypogonadism and sexual dysfunction. this study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolling approximately 160 men to assess safety and tolerability, as well as the ability of fispemifene to improve the sexual function outcomes of erectile function and low libido compared to placebo in men with secondary hypogonadism.   while fispemifene at 450mg demonstrated statistically significant improvements in total, percent free and percent bioavailable testosterone compared to placebo (p < 0.0001 at both 4 and 8 weeks), the magnitude of the increase was not sufficient to achieve statistical significance for either the erectile function primary endpoint or low libido secondary endpoint. erectile function was assessed using the international index of erectile function erectile function domain (iief-ef) questionnaire and sexual encounter profile (sep) diaries and low libido/desire was assessed using the psychosexual daily questionnaire (pdq).   fispemifene was generally well-tolerated, and no new or significant safety issues arose from this study. rates of adverse events were similar between groups with the majority of adverse events being mild or moderate. there were no serious adverse events experienced on fispemifene and there were very few discontinuations. there were no elevations in testosterone above the normal range, and no concerns related to consistent increases in hemoglobin, hematocrit or prostate-specific antigen.   "we are obviously disappointed with these results," said richard pascoe, chief executive officer of apricus. "as a consequence of these results, we will discontinue all development of fispemifene in symptomatic secondary hypogonadism, and focus our resources on our other homegrown pipeline assets.  specifically, we will focus on growing ex-us vitaros(r) revenues, seeking us vitaros approval in 2017, and advancing rayva(tm) with a phase2 clinical development program.  we believe that focusing on these higher return assets, along with streamlining the organization and reducing our operating expenses, is in the best interest of shareholders."   "while we did see statistically meaningful changes in testosterone levels into the low normal ranges with fispemifene, the compound's ability to increase those levels sufficiently to demonstrate clinical benefit is limited, and may be an issue with the entire serm class. the regulatory benchmark for approval of a compound in secondary hypogonadism in men is the achievement of a symptomatic clinical benefit, using patient-reported outcome (pro) measures in a defined patient population. achievement of biochemical or pk normalization of testosterone into the low normal range is not sufficient for regulatory purposes," said barbara troupin, md, chief medical officer of apricus.   the company will host a conference call on monday, march 28, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. eastern time to discuss the topline results and the company's focus moving forward. to participate by telephone, please dial (877) 841-3961 (domestic) or (201) 689-8589 (international). the conference id number is 13633850. the live audio webcast can be accessed via the investors section of the company's website at www.apricusbio.com. please log in approximately 5-10 minutes before the event to ensure a timely connection. the archived webcast will remain available for thirty days following the live call.   about apricus biosciences, inc.   apricus biosciences, inc.

alder reports phase2b trial of ald403 meets primary and secondary endpoints demonstrating migraine prevention in patients with chronic migraine   alder also reports positive phase1 data supporting quarterly single injection dosing strategy for ald403   alder to host conference call at 8:30 a.m. eastern time today   bothell, wash., march 28, 2016 (globe newswire) -- alder biopharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:aldr), today announced positive topline data from two clinical trials evaluating ald403, alder's proprietary monoclonal antibody product candidate for migraine prevention that targets calcitonin gene-related peptide (cgrp). positive topline data from a phase2b study of patients with chronic migraine demonstrated that ald403 acted rapidly and prevented migraine over the entire 12 week study period, meeting both primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  additionally, positive phase1 study data demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by intravenous (iv), subcutaneous (sc) or intramuscular (im) injection of ald403 support a quarterly single injection dosing strategy.   randall c. schatzman, ph.d., president and chief executive officer of alder, commented: "today's ald403 phase2b data confirm and expand on our previous data demonstrating robust efficacy in migraine prevention in a severely afflicted patient group. evaluation of ald403 continues to exhibit a potential best-in-class profile, which includes immediate, significant and durable migraine prevention with infrequent quarterly dosing. today's data also support our quarterly dosing strategy via a single intravenous, subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. with our commitment to the accelerated development of ald403 reinforced by today's positive results, we look forward to advancing our development plan, and assuming fda approval, independently marketing ald403 in the us to meet the critical medical needs of the 13 million patients nationwide who are candidates for migraine prevention therapy."   phase2b clinical trial evaluating ald403 in patients with chronic migraine   the phase2b clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, single intravenous infusion, dose ranging study in patients with chronic migraine. patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg of ald403 or placebo (approximately 120 patients per group). the primary efficacy endpoint of the study is the change in migraine days between ald403 and placebo as determined by the 75% responder rates over a 12-week period. endpoints will also be evaluated at week 24 (expected q3 2016) and at week 48 (end of study).   chronic migraine sufferers are defined as individuals who experience 15 or more headache days

safety profile was consistent with earlier ald403 clinical trials.   phase1 clinical trial evaluating multiple doses of ald403 in healthy volunteers   the phase1 clinical trial is a placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-dose, double dummy, quarterly-dosing study comparing the intravenous, subcutaneous and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy volunteers. sixty healthy volunteers, 12 in each group, were randomized as follows:   -- 100 mg ald403 im, placebo sc, placebo iv   -- 100 mg ald403 sc, placebo im, placebo iv   -- 100 mg ald403 iv, placebo im, placebo sc   -- 300 mg ald403 im, placebo sc, placebo iv   -- placebo im, placebo sc, placebo iv   individuals were dosed on day 1 and at week 12.   the study evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints for the administration of ald403 delivered via each of the three routes of administration.   key points    -- ald403 provided a comparable level of suppression of peripheral cgrp       biology for a full 3 months when administered via a single intravenous       (100 mg), subcutaneous (100 mg) or intramuscular injection (100 mg or 300       mg).      -- ald403 administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of       administration had an approximately 80% bioavailability relative to an       intravenous infusion.      -- local tolerability via all modes of administration was excellent.      -- the safety profile was consistent with earlier ald403 clinical trials.      -- the data support a quarterly dosing strategy as a single injection by all       modes of administration.   the results of this study provide an important bridge between pharmacodynamic monitoring via peripheral cgrp blockade and migraine prevention: doses (100mg and 300mg) that provided for a full 3 months of migraine prevention in the phase2b study of chronic migraine patients also provided 3 months of suppression of peripheral cgrp biology independent of route of administration.   additional results, including future analysis of additional secondary endpoints, from both of these trials are expected to be presented at upcoming medical meetings and published in peer-reviewed medical journals.   conference call and webcast   alder will host a conference call at 8:30 a.m. et today to discuss these clinical trial results. the live call may be accessed by dialing 877-430-4657 for domestic callers or 484-756-4339 for international callers and by providing conference id number 80096426.   a simultaneous webcast with slides will be broadcast live on the investors section of alder's website at www.alderbio.com and will be available for replay following the call for 30 days.   about ald403   ald403 is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that inhibits calcitonin gene-related peptide, or cgrp, for prevention of migraine. cgrp is a small protein with a well-established role in the initiation, mediation, transmission and heightened sensitivity to pain experienced in migraine. ald403 was discovered by alder scientists and has been evaluated in multiple clinical trials evaluating approximately 800 patients. in a proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic migraine, ald403 demonstrated significant prevention of migraines, including complete migraine relief (100% suppression of migraine occurrence) in 27% to 41% of patients in any given month. migraines were completely prevented in 16% of patients for the entire three-month study period. ald403 also has a favorable emerging safety profile, demonstrating a similar level of safety to placebo, and has been well-tolerated in studies to date. alder initiated its late-stage clinical trial program in october 2015 with prevention of migraine via intravenous ald403 safety and efficacy 1 (promise 1), a pivotal clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic migraine. alder plans to initiate a second pivotal clinical trial, prevention of migraine via intravenous ald403 safety and efficacy 2 (promise 2), in patients with chronic migraine in the second half of 2016. also in 2016, alder further plans to enter late-stage clinical development of a self-injected formulation of ald403 to complement the infusion formulations evaluated in the promise 1 and 2 trials.   about migraine   migraine is a common neurological disorder that results in suffering caused by intense sharp or throbbing pain in the head, commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting and high sensitivity to light and sound. over time, patients may be subject to an increasing frequency and severity of migraine attacks, potentially leading to significant disability.   the migraine research foundation estimates that 36 million american adults and children suffer from migraines. according to the american migraine foundation, migraine is three times more common in women than men and affects 30% of women over a lifetime. migraines can severely restrict normal activities and often make holding a job or maintaining a normal lifestyle difficult. the migraine research foundation estimates us employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to migraine.   currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate and botulinum toxin, or botox. medication side-effects, such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance, often limit the use of migraine medications, according to the american migraine foundation. the us agency for healthcare research and quality reports that only about 12% of adults with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications. alder believes this creates a significant unmet medical need for new treatments with improved safety and efficacy that can either prevent migraines completely or reduce the frequency to a level where patients can find adequate relief from existing abortive medications.
genital herpes immunotherapy gen-003 shows sustained reduction of viral shedding rate, durable impact on clinical disease 12 months post-dosing   - consistent efficacy across potential phase3 clinical trial endpoints -   - once-yearly or less frequent maintenance dosing expected -   - company to host conference call at 9 a.m. et today -   cambridge, mass., march 31, 2016 (globe newswire) -- genocea biosciences, inc. (nasdaq:gnca), a biopharmaceutical company developing t cell-directed vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive 12 month efficacy data from its phase2 dose optimization trial evaluating gen-003 for the treatment of genital herpes. gen-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions compared to baseline in the rate of viral shedding 12 months after dosing across multiple dose groups as well as sustained efficacy at multiple dose levels across secondary endpoints measuring the impact on clinical disease. gen-003 was safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine in the trial.   "we are very pleased with these data, which show that gen-003 has strong and durable effects on both hsv-2 viral activity and genital herpes clinical disease, supporting our belief that gen-003 could become a cornerstone treatment for patients affected by this serious disease. specifically, a single course of treatment of gen-003 may offer benefits similar to a full year of daily administration of oral antivirals -- but with greatly improved convenience," said chip clark, president and chief executive officer of genocea. "we anticipate reporting virologic efficacy data for gen-003 from our recently-initiated phase2b study in the third quarter of 2016, clinical efficacy data at 6 months post dosing around the end of 2016 and conducting our end of phase2 meeting with the fda in the first quarter of 2017."   "these 12 month data highlight the potential of gen-003 to significantly enhance the genital herpes treatment landscape,"  said lori a. panther, m.d., mph, infectious diseases specialist at beth israel deaconess medical center and assistant professor of medicine at harvard medical school. "because of the physical and psychological impact of this disease, both patients and treating physicians would be eager to use an effective treatment that more conveniently improves control of outbreaks. the reduction in viral shedding, which is thought to cause the epidemic spread of genital herpes, is also encouraging."   genocea has already advanced the two most promising doses, 60 ug per protein combined with either 50 or 75 ug of matrix-m2(tm)  auvant, from this phase2 dose optimization study into an ongoing phase2b efficacy trial. the efficacy of gen-003 at these two dose levels over the course of the phase2 dose optimization trial is as follows:                60 ug per protein /                        60 ug per protein /               50 ug of matrix-m2

present the full data from the phase2 dose optimization trial at an upcoming scientific meeting.   about the gen-003 phase2 clinical trial   this phase2 study enrolled 310 subjects from 17 institutions in the united states. subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30 ug or 60 ug per protein paired with one of three auvant doses (25 ug, 50 ug, or 75 ug). a seventh group received placebo. subjects received three doses of gen-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of hsv-2 dna, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. this 28-day observation period was repeated immediately after the completion of dosing and at six and, twelve months following dosing. no booster doses were given. after the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing, patients in the placebo arm were rolled over across the 6 active combinations of gen-003 and matrix-m2 under a separate protocol.   for more information about this clinical study of gen-003 please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.   conference call   genocea management will host a conference call and webcast today at 9 a.m. et to describe the 12 month efficacy data from the trial across all dose groups. the conference call may be accessed by dialing (844) 826-0619 for domestic participants and (315) 625-6883 for international callers (reference conference id 81824505). a live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investor relations section of the company's website at http://ir.genocea.com. a webcast replay of the conference call will be available on the genocea website beginning approximately two hours after the event, and will be archived for 30 days.   about gen-003   inducing a t cell response against hsv-2 is critical to treating the clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the infection. gen-003 is a first-in-class t-cell directed immunotherapy designed to elicit both a t cell and b cell (antibody) immune response. the immunotherapy was designed using genocea's atlas(tm) platform, which profiles the comprehensive spectrum of actual t cell responses mounted by humans in response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive t cell response. gen-003 includes the antigens icp4 and gd2 along with matrix-m2(tm) auvant, which genocea licenses from novavax, inc. for more information about gen-003, please visit http://www.genocea.com/platform-pipeline/pipeline/gen003-for-genital-herpes/.     about genital herpes   genital herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes recurrent, painful genital lesions. it can be transmitted to sexual partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. current genital herpes therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a process which drives disease transmission. incomplete control of genital lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management. immunity through t cells is believed to be particularly critical to the control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.   about genocea   genocea is harnessing the power of t cell immunity to develop life-changing vaccines and immunotherapies. t cells are increasingly recognized as a critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases, but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets of such protective immune response. using atlas, its proprietary technology platform, genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid development of medicines to address critical patient needs. genocea's pipeline of novel clinical stage t cell-enabled product candidates includes gen-003 for genital herpes, gen-004 for the prevention of infection by all serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis, malaria and cancer immunotherapy. for more information, please visit the company's website at

repros reports positive clinical data for vaginal proellex(r) in women with severe menstrual bleeding due to uterine fibroids    -- primary endpoint of induction of amenorrhea met for both vaginal doses       compared to placebo, p<0.0011     -- proellex(r)-treated subjects reported a median 100% reduction in diary       reports of menstrual bleeding product usage (pbac)     -- statistically significant reduction in fibroid size from baseline       achieved for the combined active arms compared to increase in fibroid       volume in placebo arm, p=0.0437     -- low dose oral data from a comparable study to be reported in q2 2016   the woodlands, texas, april 12, 2016 (globe newswire) -- repros therapeutics inc.(r) (nasdaq:rprx) today reported that vaginal administration of proellex(r) at doses of both 6 and 12 mg achieved significant reduction in excessive menstrual bleeding, the key symptom of uterine fibroids.   normal menstrual blood loss in a menstrual cycle is approximately 35 ml. woman experiencing blood loss of >80 ml are considered to suffer from menorrhagia or excessive menstrual bleeding. in this small phase2b study, 13, 15 and 14 women with confirmed uterine fibroids were enrolled in the 6mg, 12mg and placebo arms, respectively. at baseline, the mean amount of blood lost for one menstrual cycle was 255 ml, 274 ml and 238 ml for each arm, respectively. the blood loss ranged from a low of 94 ml to a high of 654 ml. the most severe menstrual bleeding at baseline was observed in the 12 mg group. blood loss was determined by collecting all sanitary products used from an individual and then an alkaline hematin assay was performed to estimate the actual amount of blood collected in the pads.   when a sufficient concentration of proellex(r) is achieved in circulation, amenorrhea (cessation of menses) is achieved. just over half, 52%, of proellex(r) -treated subjects became amenorrheic with no evidence of a dose effect. all subjects treated with placebo continued to menstruate throughout the 18 week dosing period. the p-value for this comparison is 0.0011. bleeding diaries consistently report a statistically significant difference in the number of days of bleeding and bleeding intensity between those treated with proellex(r) and placebo.   bleeding was also evaluated by pbac (pictorial blood assessment chart). subjects tallied sanitary product usage and stain size as guided by the chart.  proellex(r) -treated subjects reported a median 100% reduction in pbac scores while placebo-treated subjects reported a 25.4% reduction, further supporting the treatment affect associated with bleeding (p=0.0033).    along with changes in menstrual patterns, fibroids measured by mri were reduced in volume in the proellex(r) -treated arms by 18% while the placebo group showed continued increase in size, p= 0.0437.   the drug was generally well tolerated. women in the drug arms continued to exhibit levels of estradiol consistent with bone preservation.   after the first 18 week treatment period, the women were withdrawn from drug to allow for menses. the women in the study are currently being treated with the second course of treatment for another 18 weeks. the study treatment assignment remains blinded to the subjects, physicians and those managing the study and data. the results of the second course of treatment should be reported within the next 5 months.   the company believes proellex(r) represents a significant advantage over gnrh agonists and antagonists in the treatment of uterine fibroids. once both the vaginal and oral studies complete both 18 week courses of treatment the company plans to request an end of phase2 meeting with the fda to jointly discuss plans for phase3.   about repros therapeutics inc.(r)   repros therapeutics focuses on the development of small molecule drugs for major unmet medical needs that treat male and female reproductive disorders. 
june 6, 2016 11:00:00 utc primary endpoint for ocular itching not achieved  conference call today at 8:30 am eastern time  ocular therapeutix, inc. (nasdaq:ocul), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced topline results from its second phase3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dextenza™ (sustained release dexamethasone) intracanalicular depot for the treatment of ocular itching associated with chronic allergic conjunctivitis. dextenza is a product candidate administered by a physician as a bioresorbable intracanalicular depot and designed for drug release to the ocular surface for up to 30 days.  the single primary endpoint of the trial, defined as the difference in the mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo comparator group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots, was not achieved. while mean ocular itching was seen to be numerically lower (more favorable) in the dextenza treatment group compared to the placebo group measured 7 days following insertion of the depots, at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -0.18, -0.29, and -0.29 units, respectively, on a five point scale, this difference did not reach statistical significance. in addition, the trial did not achieve the requirement of at least a 0.5 unit difference at all three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots and at least a 1.0 unit difference at the majority of the three time points between the treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots.  the trial also assessed conjunctival redness as a secondary endpoint. the differences in the mean scores in conjunctival redness between the dextenza treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots at 7, 15 and 20 minutes were -0.35, -0.39 and -0.42, respectively, compared with values of -0.26, -0.32 and -0.41, respectively, at the same time points 7 days following insertion of the depots in the first phase3 trial.  the results from the second phase3 trial contrast with those achieved in the first phase3 clinical trial of dextenza for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis announced in october 2015, in which the primary endpoint of treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved, with mean ocular itching scores being lower in the dextenza group at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -1.02, -0.87, and -1.04 units, respectively (p<0.0001), 7 days following insertion of the depots.  in the second phase3 clinical trial, as well as other dextenza clinical trials completed to date regardless of indication, dextenza has exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated. there were no serious adverse events observed in the second phase3 clinical trial.  “we are disappointed that the primary endpoint of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was not achieved in our second phase3 trial in these patients, and this result is inconsistent with what we saw in our first phase3 trial,” said amar sawhney, ph.d., president, chief executive officer and chairman. “we are currently in the process of conducting a thorough analysis of the data from the second phase3 trial to fully understand the difference in efficacy between the two phase3 trials. there was a greater variability in ocular itching exhibited by patients in the second phase3 trial over the multiple allergen challenges 7, 14 and 28 days following insertion of the depots, compared to the first phase3 trial. in a post hoc analysis, when ocular itching scores were averaged over these multiple visits, a statistically significant reduction of symptoms over the entire 1 month intended duration of sustained release, single dose therapy was observed in the dextenza treatment group relative to the placebo vehicle group. since this analysis was not part of the original end points, we plan to meet with the fda to discuss the results and chart an appropriate path forward for the development of dextenza for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.”  dr. sawhney continued, “we remain confident in the potential of our innovative sustained release platform to address diverse applications in ophthalmology. we look forward to the july 2016 pdufa date for dextenza for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain.”  second phase3 study design  this phase3 prospective, us-based multicenter, 1:1 randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled trial in 86 patients was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dextenza™ (sustained release dexamethasone), intracanalicular depot for the treatment of signs and symptoms of chronic allergic conjunctivitis. this was the second phase3 trial which evaluated dextenza versus a placebo vehicle punctum plug using ophthalmic research associate’s modified conjunctival allergen challenge (ora-cac®) model (ora, inc., andover, ma), which accommodates for the longer therapeutic effect of a seasonal one-time administered drug product.  the trial was designed to assess the effect of dextenza compared with placebo on allergic reactions. dextenza or placebo was administered 48 to 72 hours after the first set of allergen challenges confirming the appropriate allergen and dose exposure to incite an allergic response, followed by three series of successive allergen challenges over a 30 day period. the primary efficacy endpoint evaluated was the difference in mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots. the trial also included a secondary efficacy endpoint for conjunctival redness which evaluated the difference in mean scores in conjunctival redness between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots.  ocular therapeutix reported topline results of its first phase3 allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial with dextenza in october 2015, where the primary endpoint for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved and the primary endpoint for conjunctival redness was not achieved.  about allergic conjunctivitis  allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva resulting primarily from a reaction to allergy-causing substances such as pollen or pet dander. the primary symptom of this inflammation is acute ocular itching and the primary sign is conjunctival redness. allergic conjunctivitis ranges in clinical severity from relatively mild, common forms to more severe forms that can cause impaired vision. according to a study on the management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis published in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal acta ophthalmologica, allergic conjunctivitis affects 15% to 40% of the us population. for patients with chronic or more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are often not sufficient to treat their signs and symptoms. many ocular allergy sufferers are not responsive to the conventional dual-acting antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers. these refractory patients are frequently treated with topical corticosteroids administered by eye drops.  about the modified conjunctival allergen challenge (ora-cac®) model  the modified ora-cac® model used in the recently completed clinical trial has been developed to study the interactions between the early and late phases of the allergic response in the eye, and to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical intervention. the modified ora-cac® model utilizes four challenges conducted over a 2-day interval to evaluate the effectiveness of a test agent to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction, as well as evaluate the test agent’s ability to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction in the presence of subclinical late phase inflammation.  conference call & webcast information  members of the ocular therapeutix management team will host a live conference call and webcast today at 8:30 am eastern time to discuss these results.  the live webcast can be accessed by visiting the investor section of the company’s

marinus pharmaceuticals announces topline results from phase3 trial in adult focal onset seizures   conference call today at 8:00 a.m. et   radnor, pa., june 13, 2016 (globe newswire) -- marinus pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:mrns), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders, today announced topline results from its phase3 clinical trial in adults with drug-resistant focal onset seizures.  in this trial, ganaxolone did not meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant difference from placebo. consistent with previously conducted studies, ganaxolone was generally safe and well tolerated.  marinus plans to discontinue its program in adult focal onset seizures and focus its efforts on advancing ganaxolone in status epilepticus and pediatric orphan indications.   christopher m. cashman, chief executive officer of marinus pharmaceuticals, commented, "we are disappointed with the outcome of this study, and the unfortunate impact on the epilepsy community and particularly the patients suffering from drug-resistant focal onset seizures who are benefiting from ganaxolone treatment. we remain confident in the safety profile of ganaxolone and its ability to effectively reduce seizures in targeted patient populations.  we are committed to building our ganaxolone franchise and are confident in the potential of ganaxolone in the treatment of status epilepticus and pediatric orphan seizure and behavior disorders. we will provide an update in the upcoming weeks on our clinical programs in these indications."   the study missed its primary endpoint of percent change in the 28-day seizure frequency from baseline (p=0.1537). the median percent reduction of focal onset seizures in the ganaxolone group was 21.28% compared to 10.25% with placebo during the titration and the 12-week treatment period.   the safety profile of ganaxolone in this study was consistent with previously conducted studies.  overall, ganaxolone was generally safe and well tolerated with no imbalance between the ganaxolone and placebo group in the number of patients with serious adverse events reported (5% vs. 5.1%). the most common adverse events (>5%) reported at greater rates than placebo were somnolence (23.5% vs 4.5%), dizziness (19.6% vs 4.5%) and fatigue (11.7% vs 6.8%). the majority of these adverse events were rated as mild in severity. there were 44 (25%) patients on ganaxolone that discontinued the study compared to 26 (14%) patients on placebo. the most common reason for discontinuation was adverse event.   the phase3 multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at 61 sites in the united states, germany, poland, australia, bulgaria and russia.  the study randomized 359 patients into two arms, ganaxolone 1800 mg/day (n=179) and placebo (n=180). the mean age of the study population was 41 with 63% percent of the participants being female. mean years since epilepsy diagnosis was 24.5 years.  76% of the patients were receiving two or more concomitant aed's and 12% had been treated with vagus nerve stimulator.   dr. albena patroneva, chief medical officer of marinus pharmaceuticals, commented, "the design, conduct, patient demographics and median separation versus placebo were similar to our positive phase2 trial and other studies conducted with recently approved antiepileptic drugs. while we did not see the incremental efficacy at a higher dose that we were hoping to achieve, ganaxolone continued to display a good safety profile -- a key attribute for the product's future development. we will leverage the findings from this study in the conduct of our ongoing and future studies in pediatric orphan indications and status epilepticus."   conference call details   marinus will host a conference call today at 8:00 a.m. eastern time. shareholders and other interested parties may

but chronic treatment is complicated by side effects, including cardiovascular risks, liver enzyme induction, kidney stones, behavioral changes, sedation and adverse effects on cognitive function, drug tolerance, and reproductive risk. according to decision resources, in 2014 approximately five million people were under treatment for epilepsy in the united states, europe and japan. despite the many available aeds, approximately 30 to 35% of patients do not attain acceptable seizure control either with a single aed or polypharmacy. furthermore, medications with significant side effects or dosing regimens that undermine compliance make it difficult for patients to achieve and maintain seizure free status. for these reasons there is a need for new aeds with novel mechanisms of action and improved side effect profiles that can maintain seizure control with chronic administration for people with drug-resistant epilepsy.   about ganaxolone   ganaxolone is a cns-selective gaba(a) modulator being developed in three different dose forms (iv, capsule, and liquid) intended to maximize therapeutic reach to adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute and chronic care settings. ganaxolone acts on a well-characterized synaptic and extrasynaptic gaba(a)  target known for anti-seizure and anti-anxiety activity. ganaxolone has been studied in more than 1,300 subjects, both pediatric and adult, at therapeutically relevant dose levels and treatment regimens for up to two years. in these studies, ganaxolone was generally safe and well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse events of somnolence, dizziness and fatigue.   about marinus pharmaceuticals   marinus pharmaceuticals, inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of ganaxolone, which offers a new mechanism of action, demonstrated efficacy and safety and convenient dosing, to improve the lives of patients suffering from epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders. ganaxolone is a cns-selective gaba(a) modulator that acts on a well-characterized target in the brain known to have both anti-seizure and anti-anxiety effects. ganaxolone is being developed in three different dose forms (iv, capsule and liquid) intended to maximize therapeutic reach to adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute and chronic care settings. ganaxolone iv is planned to enter clinical trials in 2016 and is being developed to treat status epilepticus. ganaxolone iv is complemented by its oral dose forms, providing the potential for iv-to-oral continuation therapy for patients transitioning from acute care to outpatient settings. ganaxolone capsule and liquid are being studied in orphan pediatric indications with comorbidities in seizures and behavior disorders -- pcdh19 epilepsy and fragile x syndrome. for more information visit www.marinuspharma.com.   forward-looking statements   to the extent that statements contained in this press release are not descriptions of

revance says results of realise 1 study of rt001 did not meet endpoints - revance therapeutics reported results from its realise 1 phase3 trial of daxibotulinumtoxina topical gel (rt001) to treat patients with moderate to severe lateral canthal lines, or crow's feet. in realise 1, daxibotulinumtoxina topical gel (rt001) did not achieve its co-primary and other endpoints. the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the trial were composite measurements of 2-point or greater and 1-point or greater improvement in lateral canthal lines between baseline and 28 days after treatment, as graded by the investigator's global assessment of lateral canthal lines (iga-lcl) and the patient severity assessment. rt001 topical generally appeared to be well-tolerated in this study.
tesaro's niraparib significantly improved progression-free survival for patients with ovarian cancer in both cohorts of the phase3 nova trial    -- the nova trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of pfs in the       germline brca mutant cohort     -- the nova trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of pfs in the       non-germline brca mutant cohort, including both the hrd-positive and       overall analysis populations     -- nova is the first successful prospectively designed phase3 trial of a       parp inhibitor     -- nda and maa submissions are planned for q4 2016   waltham, mass., june 29, 2016 (globe newswire) -- tesaro, inc. (nasdaq:tsro), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the phase3 nova trial of niraparib successfully achieved its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (pfs). this trial demonstrated that niraparib significantly prolonged pfs compared to control among patients who are germline brca mutation (gbrcamut) carriers, among patients who are not germline brca mutation (non-gbrcamut) carriers but who have homologous recombination deficient (hrd) tumors as determined by the myriad mychoice(r) hrd test, and overall in patients who are not germline brca mutation carriers.   an infographic accompanying this release is available at:  http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/attachmentng/f065a7ab-070d-4dc3-8c87-ae4fa8deabd1    videos accompanying this release are available at:

double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase3 trial of niraparib that enrolled more than 500 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. there is currently no therapy approved by the us food and drug administration for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian cancer following response to platinum.   "we are extremely grateful to the patients, caregivers, and investigators who participated in the nova trial. the results of this study, which is the first successful, prospectively designed, randomized, well-controlled phase 3 study of a parp inhibitor, demonstrate that a single, daily, oral dose of niraparib is superior to control in prolonging pfs in women with recurrent ovarian cancer," said mary lynne hedley, ph.d., president and coo of tesaro. "importantly, these results show activity of niraparib in a population of ovarian cancer patients beyond those with germline brca mutations. in keeping with our mission of responsible drug development, nova was designed to define those patients most likely to benefit from niraparib treatment and, in so doing, optimize the benefit/risk profile for patients. we believe we have achieved that goal and look forward to presentation of the full data set from this study at the european society for medical oncology (esmo) congress in october."   statistically significant pfs results in the gbrcamut cohort   among patients who were germline brca mutation carriers, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.27. the median pfs for patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared to 5.5 months for control (p < 0.0001).   statistically significant pfs results in non-gbrcamut cohort for patients with hrd positive tumors   for patients who were not germline brca mutation carriers but whose tumors were determined to be hrd positive using the myriad mychoice(r) hrd test, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.38. the median pfs for patients with hrd-positive tumors who were treated with niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for control (p < 0.0001).   statistically significant pfs results in the overall non-gbrcamut cohort   niraparib also showed statistical significance in the overall non-germline brca mutant cohort, which included patients with both hrd-positive and hrd-negative tumors. the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.45. the median pfs for patients treated with niraparib was 9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control (p < 0.0001).   the most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events among all patients treated with niraparib were thrombocytopenia (28.3%), anemia (24.8%) and neutropenia (11.2%). adverse events were generally managed via dose modifications. the discontinuation rate was 14.7% for niraparib treated patients and 2.2% for control. the rates of mds/aml in the niraparib (1.3%) and control (1.2%) arms were similar. there were no deaths among patients during study treatment.   "the majority of women who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer will experience a relapse of their disease, even if they respond to their initial chemotherapy," said dr. tom herzog, m.d., clinical director, university of cincinnati cancer institute and professor, department of obstetrics and gynecology at the university of cincinnati. "new treatment options are needed to extend the time in between cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy for these patients, and the results from the nova study suggest that niraparib could represent an important new treatment option for many patients with ovarian cancer."   "while the identification of mutations in the brca genes was a significant advancement, ovarian cancer remains the deadliest of gynecologic cancers, and new diagnostic and therapeutic options are needed," said david barley, chief executive officer of the national ovarian cancer coalition. "the results of the nova trial are encouraging for patients and their families, and we look forward to seeing the full results of this study this fall."   about the phase3 nova clinical trial of niraparib   nova is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase3 trial of niraparib that planned to enroll 490 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. patients were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline brca mutation status. one cohort enrolled patients who were germline brca mutation carriers (gbrcamut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who were not germline brca mutation carriers (non-gbrcamut). the non-gbrcamut cohort included patients with hrd-positive tumors, including those with somatic brca mutations and other hr defects, and patients with hrd-negative tumors. within each cohort, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo and were treated continuously with placebo or 300 milligrams of niraparib, dosed as three 100 milligram tablets once per day, until progression. the primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (pfs). secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, chemotherapy-free interval length, pfs2, overall survival, and other measures of safety and tolerability.  more information about this trial is available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01847274.   niraparib is an investigational agent and, as such, has not been approved by the us fda or any other regulatory agencies.   about homologous recombination deficiency (hrd)   homologous recombination deficiency (hrd) is a defect in high-fidelity, double-strand dna repair. hrd results from a variety of causes, including mutations in brca and other genes involved in dna repair, as well as other unidentified causes.  in cells with hrd, such as brca1 and brca2 mutant cells, lack of functional dna repair pathways, including parp, leads to irreparable double-strand breaks, genomic instability, and ultimately cell death. because hrd-positive cells are sensitive to dna-damaging processes, they are reliant upon proper dna repair by other pathways, including parp-dependent pathways.   comprehensive assessment of hrd status includes both tbrca mutational analysis and assessment of genomic instability through the combined analysis of hrd biomarker components loh, tai, and lst. mychoicehrd(r) is a registered trademark of myriad genetics, inc.   about niraparib   niraparib is an oral, once-daily parp inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in three ongoing pivotal trials. tesaro is building a robust niraparib franchise by assessing activity across multiple tumor types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. the ongoing development program for niraparib includes the phase3 trial in patients with ovarian cancer (the nova trial) as described above; a registrational phase2 treatment trial in patients with ovarian cancer (the quadra trial); a phase3 trial for the treatment of patients with brca-positive breast cancer (the bravo trial); and a phase3 trial in patients with first-line ovarian cancer (the prima trial). several collaborator-sponsored studies are also underway, including combination trials of niraparib plus pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. janssen biotech has licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in japan.   about ovarian cancer   approximately 22,000 women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer in the united states, and nearly 80% are diagnosed after the disease has become symptomatic and has progressed to a late stage. ovarian cancer is the fifth most frequent cause of cancer death among women. despite high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy in the second-line advanced treatment setting, 90% of patients will experience recurrence within two years. if approved, niraparib may address the difficult "watchful waiting" periods experienced by patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in between cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy.
sage reports positive topline results including demonstration of 30-day durability from phase2 clinical trial of sage-547 in severe postpartum depression   primary endpoint achieved with statistical significance at 60 hours maintained through 30 days   70% remission achieved at 60 hours of sage-547 treatment and maintained at 30-day follow-up   company expects to pursue further development of sage-547 and sage-217 for ppd in a global clinical program   conference call scheduled for 8:00 am et today cambridge, mass.--(business wire)--july 12, 2016--   sage therapeutics (nasdaq:sage), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system disorders, today announced positive topline results from its phase2 clinical trial of sage-547 for the treatment of severe postpartum depression (ppd). sage-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in the ham-d score compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). this represented a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the sage-547 group at the primary endpoint of 60 hours through trial completion with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. the statistically significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours, (p=0.006) with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01). remission from depression, as determined by a ham-d <=7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the sage-547 group compared with 1 of 11 in the placebo group (p=0.008). similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10 of the sage-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission (p=0.03). sage-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. a greater number of adverse events were reported in the placebo arm than in the treatment arm of the trial. there are no approved therapies specifically for ppd and therapeutic options in severe ppd are limited.   "this is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date," said samantha meltzer-brody, m.d., m.p.h., associate professor and director of the unc perinatal psychiatry program of the unc center for women's mood disorders and primary investigator for the ppd-202 trial. "the rapid onset of action of this drug observed in the trial is unlike anything else available in the field to date. the data show the potential of the drug to provide relief from the debilitating symptoms of ppd, and to markedly decrease suffering in women who are severely affected."   this was a phase2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1 randomization trial that was designed to enroll up to 32 women. the population studied were women with severe ppd (ham-d >=26) who developed severe depression either in the third trimester or within four weeks of childbirth. at baseline, the mean ham-d scores for both groups was greater than 28. the primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of sage-547 on depression as measured by the ham-d score, compared to placebo, at 60 hours. in addition, patients were monitored during a 30-day follow-up period to assess both safety and efficacy.   "these data speak for themselves. the unmet need in the ppd patient population cannot be overstated. given the societal impact of this condition, and the possible identification of a biological basis for treating these women, we are hopeful these data will point to a new understanding of this disorder and the development of effective therapies" said jeff jonas, m.d., chief executive officer of sage. "further, as the second positive placebo-controlled trial involving sage-547, the first being in essential tremor, this demonstrates the potential broad utility of our differentiated gaba mechanism and the candidate molecules in our pipeline, not only for neurological disorders, but now for mood and affective disorders as well. i am extremely proud of the great work from the sage team and we are thankful to our patients and investigators."   "there has been a long-standing need to find an effective treatment option for women with postpartum depression, not only to alleviate the suffering of those women struggling with the disease, but to mitigate the effect on their family and children. based on our review of the literature, we believe these data represent an unprecedented opportunity for developing treatments for ppd, and believe that our findings will serve as a paradigm shift in how the disease is thought about and, if our development program is successful, how ppd might be treated in the future," said steve kanes, m.d., ph.d., chief medical officer of sage. "the results of this study replicate and extend the findings of our original, open-label probe study of ppd reported previously. given the consistent activity signals seen in both our open-label and placebo-controlled trials, we also intend to examine the development pathways for several of our other proprietary pipeline compounds into the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorder and panic disorder."   secondary endpoints, including the montgomery--&#197;sberg depression rating scale (madrs), showed a similar pattern of significant difference (p=0.004) at 24 hours and maintained to 30 days (p=0.01). madrs total scores at baseline were 37.5 and 37.0 for sage-547 and placebo groups, respectively. at 60 hours post-initiation of treatment, the mean change from baseline in madrs total score for the sage-547 group was -27.9 compared with the placebo group mean change of -12.2; this treatment difference of 15.7 points was statistically significant (p=0.01). presentation of more comprehensive data from the trial is expected at future medical meetings and in publications.   the company has initiated an expansion of this phase2 clinical program to determine optimal dosing of sage-547 in ppd. this expanded trial involves dose exploration in moderate as well as severe patients, in a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial of sage-547 with enrollment to begin before the end of the year. in addition, the company intends to move forward with a ppd program involving its oral molecule, sage-217, and to seek regulatory input to determine the appropriate pathways for developing both medications for this indication.   summary of topline sage-547 phase2 study results   effect on depressive symptoms    -- the 21 patients enrolled in the trial were required to have had a major       depressive episode that began no earlier than the third trimester and no         later than the first four weeks following delivery, and to also be less       than six months postpartum at the time of enrollment. trial participants         were also required to have a ham-d score of 26 or above prior to       treatment.      -- patients were randomized one-to-one to either sage-547 or placebo, and       were administered blinded iv inpatient treatment as a continuous infusion       for 60 hours. ten patients were randomized to sage-547 treatment, while       11 patients were randomized to placebo. patients were allowed to remain       on background medications that could not be austed during treatment.       only three patients in each group were on such medications.      -- the study was designed to titrate dosing based on body weight.    -- sage-547 achieved the primary endpoint with a significant reduction in       the ham-d scale compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008).      -- sage-547 patients experienced a 19.0 point mean reduction in their ham-d         scores at 24 hours (p=0.006), achieving a greater than 10.6 point       difference from placebo at that time point and was maintained at similar         magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01).      -- results from secondary efficacy endpoints, including other rating scales         such as the madrs, reinforced the overall efficacy observed with sage-547       in the trial.      -- remission from depression, as determined by a ham-d less than or equal to       7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 sage-547 patients and 1 of       11 placebo patients (p=0.008). the remission finding in the sage-547       group was maintained out to 30 days (p=0.03), demonstrating a strong       durability of effect from sage-547 for over three weeks following the end       of treatment.   safety and tolerability:    -- sage-547 was generally well tolerated in this study. there were no deaths,       serious adverse events or discontinuations.      -- overall, fewer patients who received sage-547 experienced adverse events         compared with placebo: 4 of 10 on sage-547 and 8 of 11 on placebo.      -- similar number of patients reported nervous system disorder adverse       events: 3 of 10 on sage-547 and 4 of 11 on placebo.      -- equal number of patients reported the cluster of dizziness, sedation or       somnolence: 3 in each group.      -- fewer sage-547 patients reported psychiatric disorder adverse events: 0       of 10 on sage-547 and 5 of 11 on placebo. adverse events included       abnormal dreams, insomnia and anxiety for placebo.   conference call information   sage will host a conference call and webcast today at 8:00 am et to discuss the sage-547 topline phase2 results from the ppd-202 trial. the live webcast can be accessed on the investor page of sage's website at investor.sagerx.com. the conference call can be accessed by dialing 1-866-450-8683 (toll-free domestic) or 1-281-542-4847 (international) and using the conference id 47918013. a replay of the webcast will be available on sage's website approximately two hours after the completion of the event and will be archived for up to 30 days.   about the hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d) 
bristol-myers squibb announces topline results from checkmate -026, a phase3 study of opdivo (nivolumab) in treatment-na&#239;ve patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer   opdivo did not meet trial primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients expressing pd-l1 >= 5% princeton, n.j.--(business wire)--august 05, 2016--   bristol-myers squibb company (nyse:bmy) announced today that checkmate -026, a trial investigating the use of opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc) whose tumors expressed pd-l1 at >= 5%. the company will complete a full evaluation of the checkmate -026 data and work with investigators on the future presentation of the results.   giovanni caforio, m.d., chief executive officer, bristol-myers squibb, commented, "opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming cancer care across multiple tumor types. while we are disappointed checkmate -026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive development program, including the ongoing phase3 checkmate -227 study exploring the potential of the combination of opdivo plus yervoy for pd-l1 positive patients, and opdivo plus yervoy, or opdivo plus chemotherapy in pd-l1 negative patients."   about checkmate -026   checkmate -026 is a phase3, open-label, randomized study of opdivo as monotherapy versus investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc). patients enrolled in the trial had received no prior systemic treatment for advanced disease and tested positive for pd-l1 expression. the trial randomized 541 patients to receive either opdivo 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or investigator's choice chemotherapy in squamous patients (gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine with carboplatin/paclitaxel with carboplatin) and non-squamous patients (pemetrexed with cisplatin/pemetrexed with carboplatin) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 6 cycles. the primary endpoint is progression-free survival, as assessed by the independent radiology review committee, in patients with >= 5% pd-l1 tumor expression.   bristol-myers squibb & immuno-oncology: advancing oncology research   at bristol-myers squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that is focused on immuno-oncology, now considered a major treatment choice alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for certain types of cancer.   we have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved immuno-oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our scientists. our ongoing immuno-oncology clinical program is looking at broad patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like durability of response. we pioneered the research leading to the first regulatory approval for the combination of two immuno-oncology agents, and continue to study the role of combinations in cancer.   we are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of cancer including ctla-4, cd-137, kir, slamf7, pd-1, gitr, csf1r, ido and lag-3. these pathways may lead to potential new treatment options -- in combination or monotherapy -- to help patients fight different types of cancers.   our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech companies, to research the potential immuno-oncology and non-immuno-oncology combinations, helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in clinical practice.   at bristol-myers squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer.   about opdivo   cancer cells may exploit "regulatory" pathways, such as checkpoint pathways, to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack. opdivo is a pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint receptor pd-1 expressed on activated t-cells, and blocks the binding of pd-l1 and pd-l2, preventing the pd-1 pathway's suppressive signaling on the immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune response.   opdivo's broad global development program is based on bristol-myers squibb's understanding of the biology behind immuno-oncology. our company is at the forefront of researching the potential of immuno-oncology to extend survival in hard-to-treat cancers. this scientific expertise serves as the basis for the opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of phase3 clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a variety of tumor types. the opdivo trials have also contributed toward the clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how patients may benefit from opdivo across the continuum of pd-l1 expression. to date, the opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than 18,000 patients.   opdivo was the first pd-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory approval anywhere in the world in july 2014, and currently has regulatory approval in 54 countries including the united states, japan and in the european union.   us fda approved indications for opdivo(r)   opdivo(r) (nivolumab) as a single

involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune- mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. the majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of yervoy.   assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (lfts), adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) level, and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.   permanently discontinue yervoy and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.   immune-mediated pneumonitis   immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred with opdivo treatment. across the clinical trial experience with solid tumors, fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred with opdivo. in addition, in checkmate 069, there were six patients who died without resolution of abnormal respiratory findings. monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and symptoms of pneumonitis. administer corticosteroids for grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. permanently discontinue for grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for grade 2. in checkmate 069 and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients receiving opdivo with yervoy: fatal (n=1), grade 3 (n=6), grade 2 (n=17), and grade 1 (n=1). in checkmate 037, 066, and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.8% (14/787) of patients receiving opdivo: grade 3 (n=2) and grade 2 (n=12). in checkmate 057, immune- mediated pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (10/287) of patients: grade 3 (n=5), grade 2 (n=2), and grade 1 (n=3). in checkmate 025, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 5% (21/406) of patients receiving opdivo and 18% (73/397) of patients receiving everolimus. immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (18/406) of patients receiving opdivo: grade 4 (n=1), grade 3 (n=4), grade 2 (n=12), and grade 1 (n=1). in checkmate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9% (13/263) of patients receiving opdivo. immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4%

retrophin announces positive topline results from phase2 duet study of sparsentan in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis   combined sparsentan treatment group experienced 44.8 percent reduction of proteinuria, more than double the reduction of irbesartan; achieves statistical significance in primary efficacy endpoint   preliminary safety findings show sparsentan was generally safe and well-tolerated   conference call scheduled for today at 8:30 a.m. et   san diego, sept. 07, 2016 (globe newswire) -- retrophin, inc. (nasdaq:rtrx) today announced positive topline results from the phase2 duet study of sparsentan for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs), a rare kidney disorder without an approved pharmacologic treatment that often leads to end-stage renal disease. the study achieved statistical significance in the primary efficacy endpoint for the overall sparsentan treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria compared to irbesartan after the eight-week, double-blind treatment period.   "we are very pleased with the robust topline results from duet, which suggest sparsentan could be a significant advancement in the treatment of fsgs," said stephen aselage, chief executive officer of retrophin. "fsgs patients today face poor outcomes with limited medical options; we look forward to working with the fda to find the most expeditious path forward that would deliver the first approved pharmacologic treatment to the fsgs community."   in the duet study, the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 200, 400, and 800 mg/day of sparsentan (n=64) was 44.8 percent, compared to a mean reduction of proteinuria for all patients receiving 300 mg/day of irbesartan (n=32) of 18.5 percent (p=0.006). further, the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 400 mg and 800 mg doses of sparsentan (n=51) was 47.4 percent, compared to a mean proteinuria reduction of 19.0 percent for patients receiving 300 mg of irbesartan (n=25) in these two dose cohorts (p=0.011). the comparison of individual sparsentan dose cohorts to irbesartan showed clear signals of relative improvement, but did not reach statistical significance.   "the results from duet serve as proof of concept for sparsentan's novel approach of combining endothelin receptor type a blockade with angiotensin ii inhibition for the treatment of fsgs," said alvin shih, m.d., executive vice president and head of research & development for retrophin. "significant reductions in proteinuria, along with a well-tolerated preliminary safety profile have us excited about being one step closer to providing a new treatment option for patients with fsgs."   topline results suggest sparsentan was generally safe and well-tolerated in the duet study. one serious adverse event, anemia, classified as potentially related to treatment occurred in the sparsentan group but did not result in study discontinuation during the eight-week blinded treatment period. there were no withdrawals due to fluid retention during the eight-week blinded treatment period. all patients who completed the eight-week treatment period entered the ongoing open label extension study, and the vast majority of these patients continue to receive therapy.   the company plans to present detailed study results, including data from the open label extension, at an upcoming medical meeting or in a peer-reviewed publication.   conference call information   retrophin will

(international), confirmation code 76903331.   about the duet study   the duet study is an international, randomized, double-blind, phase2 clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in 109 patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs), of which 96 qualified for the evaluable database. the primary endpoint is the reduction of proteinuria, as compared to irbesartan, which is part of a class of drugs used to manage fsgs in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment. after a two-week washout period, patients were randomized to receive daily oral doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg of sparsentan or 300 mg of irbesartan. after completing the eight-week treatment period, all patients were eligible to receive sparsentan as part of the study's open-label extension.   about focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs)   focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or fsgs, is a rare disorder without an approved pharmacologic treatment option that is estimated to affect up to 40,000 patients in the us with similar prevalence in europe. the disorder is defined by progressive scarring of the kidney and often leads to end-stage renal disease. fsgs is characterized by proteinuria, where protein is found in the urine due to a breakdown of the normal filtration mechanism in the kidney. other common symptoms include swelling in parts of the body known as edema, as well as low blood albumin levels, abnormal lipid profiles, and hypertension.   reduction in proteinuria is widely regarded to be beneficial in the treatment of fsgs, and may be associated with a decreased risk of progression to end-stage renal disease. in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment, fsgs patients are currently managed with angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, calcineurin inhibitors, and steroids.   about sparsentan   sparsentan could be the first approved pharmacologic treatment for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or fsgs, a rare kidney disorder that often leads to end-stage renal disease. sparsentan's dual mechanism of action combines angiotensin receptor blockade with endothelin receptor type a blockade. in several forms of chronic kidney disease, endothelin receptor blockade has been shown to have an additive beneficial effect on proteinuria in combination with renin-angiotensin blockade via angiotensin receptor blockade or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.   the phase2 duet study of sparsentan met the primary efficacy endpoint for the overall treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of proteinuria compared to irbesartan, after the eight-week, double-blind treatment period. the company plans to engage the fda to determine the most expeditious path forward to advance the development of sparsentan towards approval. in 2015, the us food and drug administration and european commission each granted sparsentan orphan drug designation for the treatment of fsgs.   about retrophin   retrophin is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company dedicated to delivering life-changing therapies to people living with rare diseases who have few, if any, treatment options. the company's approach centers on its pipeline featuring clinical-stage assets targeting rare diseases with significant unmet medical needs, including sparsentan for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (fsgs), a disorder characterized by progressive scarring of the kidney often leading to end-stage renal disease, and re-024 for pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (pkan), a life-threatening neurological disorder that typically begins in early childhood. research exploring the potential of early-stage assets in several rare diseases is also underway. retrophin's r&d efforts are supported by revenues from the company's commercial products thiola(r), cholbam(r) and chenodal(r).   retrophin.com   forward-looking statements   this press

lexicon reports positive topline results in pivotal phase3 study for sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes   first successful phase3 trial of an oral anti-diabetic for type 1 diabetes   conference call and webcast september 9, 2016 at 8:00 a.m. eastern time   pr newswire   the woodlands, texas, sept. 9, 2016   the woodlands, texas, sept. 9, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- lexicon pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: lxrx) announced today that the pivotal intandem1 phase3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant reduction in a1c at 24 weeks in patients with type 1 diabetes on a background of optimized insulin.   topline results from the phase3 study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin had a mean a1c reduction from baseline of 0.43% on 200mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) and a reduction of 0.49% on 400mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study's primary endpoint. this statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in a1c for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe hypoglycemia, one of the most prevalent serious health challenges in type 1 diabetes, which was seen less frequently in both treatment arms than placebo.   "we are extremely pleased with these topline results and the potential long-term benefits that sotagliflozin may bring to people with type 1 diabetes," said lexicon president and chief executive officer lonnel coats. "we believe these results provide evidence that sotagliflozin, with its novel dual inhibition of both sglt-1 and sglt-2, is particularly well suited to help these individuals achieve better a1c levels without increasing and possibly reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia."   "our companies are working together to develop this compound for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes," said jorge insuasty, senior vice president, head of global development, sanofi.  "these topline results highlight potential benefits of sotagliflozin when treating adults with type 1 diabetes.  we congratulate our partners on this positive outcome and look forward to further exploring this compound for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes when sanofi begins the phase3 program later this year."   "the intandem1 study is part of the largest phase3 program for an oral anti-diabetic agent in type 1 diabetes to date," said anne peters, m.d., professor of medicine at the keck school of medicine of usc, director of the usc clinical diabetes programs and chairman of the sotagliflozin type 1 diabetes steering committee.  "sotagliflozin demonstrated compelling, significant and clinically meaningful a1c reduction with no increase in severe hypoglycemia and a slight risk of dka.  if approved, sotagliflozin could represent a significant addition to the current standard of care and potentially allow patients with type 1 diabetes to better manage their diabetes while on insulin."   about intandem1   the double-blind, placebo controlled, phase3 study known as intandem1 enrolled 793 patients in the united states and canada with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an a1c level entering the study between 7.0% and 11.0%, which corresponds to an estimated average blood sugar of 154 mg/dl to 269 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l to 15.0 mmol/l). the three-arm study evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin, 200mg and 400mg, each taken once daily before the first meal of the day, against placebo. prior to randomization, insulin was optimized for all patients over a six-week period, with the objective of improving glycemic control using insulin alone.  after completion of this optimization period, patients were maintained on optimized insulin and randomized to one of two doses of sotagliflozin or placebo, and their baseline, post-optimization a1c was measured.  the mean baseline a1c level at the time of randomization after the six-week optimization period was 7.6% for all three dose arms.   the primary endpoint of the study was change in a1c from baseline after a 24-week period of treatment.  the trial has a double-blind long term extension of 28-weeks, with a total treatment duration of 52-weeks. there were 268 patients in the placebo arm, 263 patients in the 200mg dose arm and 262 patients in the 400mg dose arm.  the overall mean placebo austed a1c reduction was 0.35% in the 200mg dose arm (p<0.001) and 0.41% in the 400mg dose arm (p<0.001).   sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated.  across all three dose arms (placebo, 200mg, 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (aes) were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious aes (saes) were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and discontinuation due to aes were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. there were no reported deaths in the study.   two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (dka).  the number of patients with severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18 (6.7%), 11 (4.2%), and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.  the number of patients with dka events during the 24-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%), and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.   lexicon is conducting another similar pivotal phase3 clinical trial predominantly in europe (intandem2), which is expected to report topline results by the end of the year.  the third type 1 diabetes phase3 clinical trial, intandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization. sanofi is expected to commence phase3 clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes by the end of the year.   about sotagliflozin   discovered using lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (sglt1 and sglt2). sglt1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and sglt2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney. sotagliflozin has been shown in a phase2 study to improve glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes while reducing their need for mealtime insulin.   lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with sanofi in november 2015 under which lexicon granted sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin.  lexicon is responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the united states.  sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the united states.   lexicon conference call   lexicon management will hold a conference call and webcast to discuss the intandem1 phase3 topline results at 8:00 a.m. eastern time on september 9, 2016.  the dial-in number for the conference call is 888-645-5785 (within the us/canada) or 970-300-1531 (international). the conference id for all callers is 79513441.  investors can access a live webcast of the call at www.lexpharma.com.  an archived version of the webcast will be available on the website through october 9, 2016.   about lexicon   lexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on nobel prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions. through its genome5000(tm) program, lexicon scientists have studied the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes over the last 20 years and have identified more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a range of diseases. through the precise targeting of these proteins, lexicon is pioneering the discovery and development of innovative medicines to safely and effectively treat disease. lexicon has a pipeline of promising drug candidates in clinical and pre-clinical development in oncology, diabetes and metabolism. for additional information please visit www.lexpharma.com.
september 14, 2016 20:01:00 utc roclatantm successfully achieves primary efficacy endpoint in mercury 1 study  conference call and webcast today, september 14, at 5:00 p.m. et  aerie pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:aeri), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported the successful 90-day primary efficacy results of its 12-month phase3 “mercury 1” clinical trial for its fixed-dose combination product candidate, roclatantm. the study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components, including aerie product candidate rhopressatm (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, and market leading prostaglandin analogue (pga) latanoprost, all of which were dosed once daily in the evening. the study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures (iops) ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmhg (millimeters of mercury). the iop-lowering effect of roclatantm was 1 to 3 mmhg greater than monotherapy with either latanoprost or rhopressatm throughout the duration of the study. management will host a conference call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. et today. the accompanying slides are available at aerie’s web site, aeriepharma.com.  roclatantm phase3 highlights for mercury 1  roclatantm dosed once daily achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over both latanoprost and rhopressatm at the primary endpoint range of baseline iops from above 20 to below 36 mmhg for each of the nine measured time points. iops were measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at week 2, week 6, and day 90. roclatantm iop lowering exceeded that of latanoprost in a range of 1.3 to 2.5 mmhg, and exceeded rhopressatm iop lowering in a range of 1.8 to 3.0 mmhg. efficacy levels were consistent across the 90-day period for all arms in the study. roclatantm mean diurnal iop-lowering exceeded that of latanoprost by an average across the study duration of 1.9 mmhg and exceeded rhopressatm by 2.6 mmhg. roclatantm reduced mean diurnal iops to 16 mmhg or lower in 61 percent of patients, a significantly higher percentage than observed in the comparator arms. the most common roclatantm adverse event was hyperemia, or eye redness, which was reported in approximately 50 percent of patients, or 30 percent above baseline, and was scored as mild for the large majority of these patients. there were no drug-related serious adverse events for any of the comparators in the trial. aerie will hold an “investor day” in new york city on october 5, 2016 to cover further details from the mercury 1 trial and to provide a general business update. “we are very pleased by these roclatantm 90-day efficacy results from the mercury 1 clinical trial. as expected, the topline efficacy demonstrated in this trial clearly reconfirms the potential for roclatantm to become the most efficacious iop-lowering therapy to enter the market, if approved. if mercury 1 and 2 are successful, we expect to file the nda for roclatantm near year-end 2017,” said vicente anido, jr., ph.d., chairman and chief executive officer at aerie.  dr. anido continued, “we also noted that the rhopressatm arm demonstrated high levels of efficacy across the full range of baseline iops studied, and the efficacy was maintained for the 90-day period. importantly, rhopressatm demonstrated comparable levels of iop lowering to latanoprost at baseline iops ranging from 20 to 25 mmhg in mercury 1. this performance for rhopressatm is consistent with levels observed in the previous phase2b trials for rhopressatm and roclatantm.”  richard a. lewis, m.d., aerie’s chief medical officer added, “once-daily roclatantm has shown a degree of iop lowering in mercury 1 that is quite impressive, especially when considering its ability to bring patient pressures down to levels as low as 8 to 14 mmhg. the safety profile of roclatantm observed thus far in mercury 1 points to a safe and tolerable product.”  about roclatantm  roclatantm is a once-daily eye drop that combines rhopressatm, as described below, with latanoprost, a pga that is the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug in the world. based on our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that roclatantm, if approved, would be the first glaucoma product to lower iop through all known mechanisms: (i) increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary drain, (ii) increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye’s secondary drain, (iii) reducing fluid production in the eye, and (iv) reducing episcleral venous pressure (evp). by covering the full spectrum of known iop-lowering mechanisms, roclatantm has the potential to provide a greater iop-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product.  the first phase3 registration trial for roclatantm, named mercury 1 is a 12-month safety trial in 718 patients with a 90-day efficacy readout, which is the subject of this press release. the topline efficacy readout demonstrated that roclatantm was statistically superior to each of its components. the second phase3 registration trial, named mercury 2, is a 90-day efficacy trial that commenced in march 2016, and a third phase3 registration trial, named mercury 3, is expected to commence in europe in the first half of 2017. mercury 3 is not necessary for approval in the us, but rather to facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in europe.  about rhopressatm  rhopressatm (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, is a novel eye drop that we believe, if approved, would become the only once-daily product available that, based on aerie’s preclinical studies, specifically targets the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated iop in glaucoma. preclinical studies have also demonstrated that rhopressatm lowers episcleral venous pressure, which contributes approximately half of iop in healthy subjects. further, based on aerie’s preclinical studies, rhopressatm provides an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers iop. biochemically, rhopressatm has been shown in aerie studies to inhibit both rho kinase (rock) and norepinephrine transporter (net). recent preclinical studies have also shown that rhopressatm may have disease-modifying properties, including an anti-fibrotic effect on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork. preclinical research is also currently underway to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of rhopressatm.  the results of two phase3 registration trials (rocket 2 and rocket 1) for rhopressatm were included in a nda filing submitted to the fda in the third quarter of 2016. rocket 2 represents the pivotal trial, and rocket 1 is supportive. there are two additional phase3 trials currently underway for rhopressatm, named rocket 3 and rocket 4. rocket 3 is a 12-month safety-only study in canada that is not needed for the nda filing. rocket 4 is designed to provide adequate six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in europe, and is also not needed for the nda filing.  conference call / web cast information  aerie management will host a live conference call and webcast at 5:00 p.m. eastern time today to discuss the roclatantm phase3 efficacy results from mercury 1, including a review of the associated slides that are posted on aerie’s web site, aeriepharma.com.  the live webcast and a

(nyse mkt: mstx), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure, today reported topline results from epic, a phase3 clinical study of its investigational new drug vepoloxamer (also known as mst-188) for the treatment of individuals with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (voc).  the study did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in the mean duration of voc (82 hours in the vepoloxamer group compared to 78 hours in the placebo group in the intent-to-treat population (p=0.09)).  there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the intent-to-treat population across the two secondary efficacy endpoints, rate of re-hospitalization for voc and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome. consistent with previously conducted studies, vepoloxamer was generally well tolerated with no statistically significant differences in treatment-related serious adverse events in the vepoloxamer group compared to the placebo group. no deaths occurred on the study.   "we are exceedingly disappointed with these topline results. while clearly not the outcome we wanted, we believe the insights and data from the largest placebo-controlled clinical trial ever completed in sickle cell disease will substantially advance the understanding of vaso-occlusive crisis and the still maturing clinical science necessary to support the development of new therapeutics for this debilitating disease," stated brian m. culley, the company's chief executive officer. "we wish to reiterate our sincere appreciation for all of the patients, caregivers, and others who aided us in conducting this informative study."   "these analyses are limited to just topline data, so in the coming weeks the company intends to review the full data set from epic. in addition, we plan to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing heart failure trial of vepoloxamer. however, based on the data we've seen to date, we expect we will terminate all clinical development of vepoloxamer. consequently, while we evaluate our options, we intend to significantly and immediately reduce our operating expenses and continue our efforts with air001, our lead asset in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which currently is the subject of a 100-patient phase2 study expected to complete enrollment by the end of 2017," continued mr. culley.   investor conference call   the company will hold a conference call tomorrow, september 21, 2016, at 8:00 a.m. et / 5:00 a.m. pt to discuss the phase3 results.  interested parties may access the conference call by dialing (855) 239-3120 from the us, (855) 669-9657 from canada,

was a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled, phase3 clinical trial of vepoloxamer in individuals with sickle cell disease hospitalized for acute pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis who required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia. the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vepoloxamer in reducing the duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, with the duration of crisis measured from the time of randomization to the time at which the patient received the last dose of parenteral opioid analgesia for the treatment of vaso-occlusive crisis prior to hospital discharge.  vepoloxamer or placebo (0.45% saline) was administered intravenously as a 1 hour loading dose infusion (100 mg/kg), immediately followed by a continuous maintenance infusion (30 mg/kg/hr) for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours.  randomization was stratified by age (>=4 to <16 years or >=16 to <=65 years), use of hydroxyurea (yes or no), and pain score (measured using the wong-baker faces(r) pain rating scale at time of randomization: <8 or >=8). the study was 90% powered to detect a 17% (16-hour) difference in treatment arms, with a statistical significance level of p=0.05 (assuming an average crisis duration of 96 hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation > 50%).  secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare the rates of re-hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis within 14 days of initial hospital discharge and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within 120 hours of randomization between the treatment and control groups.   a total of 388 patients, ages four to 46, were randomized in epic.  more than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated.  the average age was 15 years.  patients under age 18 accounted for approximately 71% of total subjects.  approximately 61% of patients were concurrently on hydroxyurea therapy.   about sickle cell disease and vaso-occlusive crisis   sickle cell disease is a chronic, genetic blood disorder that affects millions worldwide and an estimated 100,000 people in the united states, where it is classified as a rare, or orphan, disease.  the hallmark of sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crisis, which results from obstruction of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells causing tissue ischemia and injury.  vaso-occlusions can occur everywhere blood flows and lead to an accumulating disease burden in every organ system with the ultimate loss of vital organ function and significantly reduced lifespan.  vaso-occlusive crisis is also characterized by intense and debilitating pain which can last for days and even weeks.  there are between 80,000 to 100,000 hospitalizations annually in the us related to vaso-occlusive crisis and no fda approved treatment to shorten its duration or reduce the risk of ischemic injury related to crisis.   about mast therapeutics   mast therapeutics, inc. is a publicly traded biopharmaceutical company headquartered in san diego, california. the company is developing two clinical-stage investigational new drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions. vepoloxamer, the company's lead product candidate, is

kite pharma announces positive topline kte-c19 data from zuma-1 pivotal trial in patients with aggressive non-hodgkin lymphoma (nhl)   study met primary endpoint of objective response rate (p<0.0001) at interim analysis   first multicenter pivotal trial of car-t therapy to report positive outcome   company plans to present additional data at upcoming scientific meeting santa monica, calif.--(business wire)--september 26, 2016--   kite pharma, inc., (nasdaq:kite) today announced positive topline results from a pre-planned interim analysis of zuma-1 for its lead product candidate, kte-c19, in patients with chemorefractory diffuse large b-cell lymphoma (dlbcl). kte-c19 met the primary endpoint of objective response rate (orr), p<0.0001, with orr of 76 percent, including 47 percent complete remissions (cr).   zuma-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive nhl into two cohorts. cohort 1 included patients with dlbcl, and cohort 2 enrolled patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (tfl) and primary mediastinal b-cell lymphoma (pmbcl). kite's intent is to seek regulatory approval of kte-c19 in dlbcl, tfl and pmbcl based upon the combined data of both cohorts.   the interim analysis of zuma-1 evaluated the orr in the first 51 patients in cohort 1 with at least three months of follow-up. this analysis also included an additional 11 patients in cohort 2. the table below summarizes the response rates from this interim analysis together with the previously reported results from the phase1 portion of zuma-1 (neelapu asco 2016).                    zuma-1                phase1              zuma-1 phase2              -----------  ----------------------------------                            dlbcl     tfl/pmbcl    combined              dlbcl (n=7)   (n=51)     (n=11)       (n=62)              -----------  --------  -----------  -----------              orr    cr    orr  cr   orr    cr    orr    cr              (%)    (%)   (%)  (%)   (%)   (%)   (%)    (%) -------      ---  ------  ---  ---  ----  -----  ---  ------ orr          71     57    76   47    91    73    79     52 -----------  ---  ------  ---  ---  ----  -----  ---  ------ month 3      43     43    39   33    64    64    44     39 -----------  ---  ------  ---  ---  ----  -----  ---  ------ months 6  and 9       43     43               data pending -----------  ---  ------  ----------------------------------       across the combined 62 patients, the most common grade 3 or higher adverse events included neutropenia (66 percent), anemia (40 percent), febrile neutropenia (29 percent), thrombocytopenia (29 percent), and encephalopathy (26 percent). grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (crs) and neurological toxicity was observed in 18 percent and 34 percent of patients, respectively. two patients died from kte-c19 related adverse events (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest in the setting of crs).   the phase2 interim outcomes in zuma-1 are largely consistent with results from the phase1 portion of the study and the national cancer institute (nci) study based on the same car construct, a low-dose cyclophosphamide-fludaribine conditioning regimen, and kite's proprietary manufacturing process (kochenderfer asco 2016).   "zuma-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive nhl, a disease that is very difficult to treat. the combined cr rate of 39 percent at three months is very exciting as it represents nearly a five-fold increase from the cr rate of 8 percent seen in the scholar-1 study in a similar patient population," said jeff wiezorek, m.d., senior vice president of clinical development. "zuma-1 is the largest car-t study reported in nhl. we were able to manufacture kte-c19 for 99 percent of patients enrolled in the study, and successfully handle the study logistics and adverse event management at over 20 sites, most of which had no prior experience in car-t therapy."   additional data from this interim analysis will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. the primary analysis of 101 patients with chemorefractory aggressive nhl (dlbcl, tfl and pmbcl) will include approximately six months of follow-up and is expected in the first quarter of 2017.   "we are grateful to the study participants and investigators who have made this important research possible. what started at the nci over a decade ago with the pioneering work of steven a. rosenberg, m.d., ph.d., has evolved into a technology that has the potential to fundamentally change the outlook of patients with cancer. for patients with aggressive nhl, every day matters and a new treatment option like kte-c19 is desperately needed," said arie belldegrun, m.d., facs, chairman, president and chief executive officer of kite. "i am proud of what we have achieved to date and excited to apply our advanced learnings from zuma-1 to our ongoing clinical development programs to bring continued innovation to patients and the scientific community at large."   zuma-1 is supported in part by funding from the leukemia & lymphoma society (lls) therapy acceleration program(r) .   conference call and webcast details   kite will host a live conference call and webcast today at 4:30pm eastern time (1:30pm pacific time) to discuss the results of this interim analysis. to access the live conference call by telephone, please dial (877) 301-8565 (us) or (678) 562-4240 (international). the conference id number for the live call is 88811489. the webcast will be made available on the company's website at www.kitepharma.com under the investors tab in the events and presentations section. following the live audio webcast, a replay will be available on the company's website for approximately 30 days.   about kte-c19   kite pharma's lead product candidate, kte-c19, is an investigational therapy in which a patient's t-cells are engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (car) to target the antigen cd19, a protein expressed on the cell surface of b-cell lymphomas and leukemias, and redirect the t-cells to kill cancer cells. kte-c19 has been granted breakthrough therapy designation status for dlbcl, tfl, and pmbcl by the us food and drug administration and priority medicines (prime) regulatory support for dlbcl in the eu.   about kite pharma   kite pharma, inc., is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of novel cancer immunotherapy products, with a primary focus on engineered autologous cell therapy (eact(tm)) designed to restore the immune system's ability to recognize and eradicate tumors. kite is based in santa monica, ca. for more information on kite pharma, please visit www.kitepharma.com. sign up to follow @kitepharma on twitter at www.twitter.com/kitepharma.   cautionary note on forward-looking statements   this press release contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. we may, in some cases, use terms such as "predicts," "believes," "potential," "proposed," "continue," "estimates," "anticipates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "may," "could," "might," "will," "should" or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes to identify these forward-looking statements. forward-looking statements include statements regarding our intentions, beliefs, projections, outlook, analyses or current expectations concerning, among other things: expectations regarding the clinical effectiveness and safety of kte-c19 and timing of the primary analysis of zuma-1. various factors may cause differences between kite's expectations and actual results as discussed in greater detail in kite's filings with the securities and exchange commission, including without limitation in its form 10-q for the quarter ended june 30, 2016. any forward-looking statements that we make in this press release speak only as of the date of this press release. we assume no obligation to update our forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date of this press release. 
gw pharmaceuticals announces second positive phase3 pivotal trial for epidiolex(r) (cannabidiol) in the treatment of lennox-gastaut syndrome   - primary endpoint achieved in both epidiolex doses with high statistical significance compared to placebo -   - today's data represents the third positive phase3 pivotal trial for epidiolex reported in 2016 -   - data reinforce the potential of epidiolex to be an important new medicine for patients who suffer from this treatment-resistant childhood-onset epilepsy -   - company to hold investor conference call today at 8:00 a.m. edt/13:00 bst -   london, sept. 26, 2016 (globe newswire) -- gw pharmaceuticals plc (nasdaq:gwph) (aim:gwp) ("gw," "the company" or "the group"), a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product platform, announces positive results of the second randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase3 clinical trial of its investigational medicine epidiolex(r) (cannabidiol or cbd) for the treatment of seizures associated with lennox-gastaut syndrome (lgs), a rare and severe form of childhood-onset epilepsy. in this trial, epidiolex, when added to the patient's current treatment, achieved the primary endpoint for both dose levels with high statistical significance. during the treatment period, patients taking epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients taking epidiolex 10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 37 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0016).   this trial follows the announcement in june 2016 of positive results in the first pivotal phase3 trial of epidiolex for the treatment of seizures associated with lgs, and the march 2016 announcement of positive results in the treatment of seizures associated with dravet syndrome.  gw expects to submit a new drug application (nda) to the us food & drug administration (fda) in the first half of 2017.   "the positive outcome in this second trial of epidiolex in patients with lennox-gastaut syndrome demonstrates the effectiveness of this product in this particularly difficult to treat, childhood-onset epilepsy," stated orrin devinsky, m.d., of new york university langone medical center's comprehensive epilepsy center and principal investigator in the trial. "the data from the epidiolex dravet and lgs studies offers the prospect of an fda-approved cbd medicine that shows both clinically meaningful seizure reduction and a consistent safety and tolerability profile. i believe epidiolex has the potential to become an important new option within the field of treatment-resistant epilepsy."   "today brings great news for the lennox-gastaut syndrome community," said christina saninocencio, executive director of the lennox-gastaut syndrome foundation. "the announcement of a second set of positive results with epidiolex is exciting as they offer much needed hope for patients and their families living with this debilitating condition where new treatment options are desperately needed."   "the epilepsy foundation is thrilled to learn about the recent preliminary results for an innovative new therapy from gw for lgs. lgs in so many cases is extremely difficult to treat, and is an incredible challenge for children and families. we feel a tremendous sense of urgency to stop seizures, and believe that the pursuit of new therapies offers hope to individuals who have no currently available therapy to effectively stop their seizures. the epilepsy foundation will continue to be a champion for gw's efforts to pursue this innovative new therapy as studies progress. we thank gw and all our partners who invest in a better tomorrow for people with epilepsy," stated philip gattone, president and chief executive officer of the epilepsy foundation.   "we are very pleased to report this second positive phase3 trial in seizures associated with lennox-gastaut syndrome. this is the third positive phase3 trial for epidiolex reported in 2016. all three trials provide gw with robust evidence to support the efficacy and safety of epidiolex. this latest trial also shows that epidiolex likely has an effective dose range, allowing for dose flexibility to address individual patient needs. these compelling results make us more determined than ever to make this important new medicine available to patients who suffer from these treatment-resistant childhood-onset epilepsies," stated justin gover, gw's chief executive officer.   trial overview and result   patients aged 2-55 years with a confirmed diagnosis of drug-resistant lgs currently uncontrolled on one or more concomitant anti-epileptic drugs (aeds) were eligible to participate in this phase3, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial. the trial randomized 225 patients into three arms, where epidiolex 20mg/kg/day (n=76), epidiolex 10mg/kg/day (n=73) or placebo (n=76) was added to current aed treatment. on average, patients were taking approximately three aeds, having previously tried and discontinued an average of seven other aeds. the average age of trial participants was 16 years (30 percent were 18 years or older). the median drop seizure frequency over the 4 week baseline period was 85.   the primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was a comparison between epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in the monthly frequency of drop seizures during the 14 week treatment period (two week dose escalation period followed by 12 weeks of maintenance) compared to the 4 week baseline period before randomization. drop seizures were defined as atonic, tonic or tonic-clonic seizures involving the entire body, trunk or head that led or could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair or hitting the patient's head on a surface.   during the treatment period, patients taking epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients taking epidiolex 10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 37 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0016).   a series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint for both dose groups confirmed the robustness of these results. in both dose groups, the difference between epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of treatment and was sustained during the entire treatment period. results from secondary efficacy endpoints in both dose groups reinforced the overall effectiveness observed with epidiolex.   epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this trial.  the pattern of adverse events was consistent with that reported in the previous two phase3 studies. one patient on 10mg/kg epidiolex discontinued treatment due to an adverse event compared with six patients on 20mg/kg and one patient on placebo.   of the 84 percent of 10mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 89 percent of them deemed it to be mild or moderate.  of the 94 percent of 20mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 88 percent of them reported it to be mild or moderate. 72 percent of patients on placebo experienced an adverse event.   the most common adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of epidiolex-treated patients) in the 10mg/kg group were: somnolence, decreased appetite, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and status epilepticus. none of the cases of status epilepticus in the 10mg/kg group was deemed treatment-related. the most common adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of epidiolex-treated patients) in the 20mg/kg group were: somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, pyrexia, vomiting, and nasopharyngitis.   thirteen patients on epidiolex 10mg/kg experienced a serious adverse event (two of which were deemed treatment-related) compared with thirteen patients on 20mg/kg (five of which were deemed treatment-related) and eight patients on placebo (none of which were deemed treatment-related).   there were no deaths in this trial.   of the patients who completed this trial, 99 percent have opted to continue into an open-label extension trial.   further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.   epidiolex new drug application (nda)   following the success of the first dravet syndrome phase3 trial earlier this year, gw requested a pre-nda meeting with the fda to discuss a proposed dravet syndrome nda. this meeting took place in july 2016 and also included some discussion of data from the first phase3 lgs trial. as a result of this constructive meeting, gw believes the guidance received enables the company's proposed filing strategy to submit a single nda that includes phase3 data from one dravet trial and two lgs trials,  and which remains on track for a submission in the first half of 2017. subject to satisfactory review, gw now anticipates a simultaneous decision on both indications and does not expect to wait for results from the second trial in dravet syndrome prior to this submission.   in order to support gw's nda, the company expects to provide the fda with data from ten phase1 and phase2 studies, as well as safety data in over 1,800 patients from both the expanded access program and pivotal programs, including over 450 patients with one year or more of epidiolex continuous exposure. this data is in addition to the pivotal efficacy data.   epidiolex has orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of lgs, dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex and infantile spasms.   gw clinical trial programs in dravet syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex and infantile spasms 
incyte’s ido1 inhibitor in combination with merck’s anti-pd-1 therapy is well-tolerated and demonstrates durable clinical response in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma  incyte corporation (nasdaq: incy) today announced that the european society for medical oncology (esmo) has published an abstract (#1110pd) containing updated data from the phase1 portion of the echo-202 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, incyte’s selective ido1 enzyme inhibitor, in combination with keytruda® (pembrolizumab), merck’s anti-pd-1 therapy. these data will be highlighted in a poster discussion on monday, 10 october 2016 from 11:00-12:00 cet at the esmo annual congress 2016 in copenhagen, denmark.  in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), updated data show a disease control rate (dcr) of 74 percent and an overall response rate (orr) of 58 percent. all responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up 42 weeks); median progression-free survival (pfs) has not been reached.  “we are very pleased that after extended treatment and longer follow-up, these updated phase1 data for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrate robust, durable clinical activity in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma and reinforce the promise of ido1 inhibition in combination with an anti-pd-1 therapy as an important component of immunotherapy,” said steven stein, m.d., incyte’s chief medical officer.  epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. the most common (≥15%) all grade treatment-related adverse events (traes) were fatigue, rash, arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea and nausea. grade ≥3 traes were observed in 18% of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (3%).  the echo-202 abstract was made available today on the esmo congress website at http://esmo.org/conferences/esmo-2016-congress.  the echo-202 poster is expected to be made available to attendees at the esmo congress on friday, 7 october 2016, at which time the echo-202 poster will be made available via the events and presentations tab of the investor section of www.incyte.com. incyte will also host an investor conference call and webcast at 14:00 cet (8:00 a.m. et) on 7 october 2016 which can be accessed via the events and presentations tab of the investor section of www.incyte.com.  about echo-202 (keynote-037)  the echo-202 study (nct02178722) is evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, incyte’s selective ido1 inhibitor, in combination with pembrolizumab. patients previously treated with anti-pd-1 or anti-ctla-4 therapies were excluded from this trial. enrollment is complete for the phase1 dose escalation (epacadostat 25, 50, 100 mg bid + pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg iv q3w and epacadostat 300 mg bid + pembrolizumab 200 mg iv q3w) and phase1 dose expansion (epacadostat 50, 100, and 300 mg bid + pembrolizumab 200 mg iv q3w) portions of the trial. enrollment in the phase2 tumor-specific cohorts is ongoing.  about echo  the echo clinical trial program was established to investigate the efficacy and safety of epacadostat as a core component of combination therapy in oncology. ongoing phase1 and phase2 studies evaluating epacadostat in combination with pd-1 and pd-l1 inhibitors collectively plan to enroll over 900 patients in a broad range of solid tumor types, as well as hematological malignancies. echo-301 (nct02752074), a phase3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating pembrolizumab in combination with epacadostat or placebo as first-line treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma, is also underway. echo-301 was initiated in june 2016 and initial data from this study are expected to be available in 2018.  about epacadostat (incb024360)  indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (ido1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory t cell generation and blocking effector t cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the ido1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. in single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. in these studies, epacadostat combined with the ctla-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the pd-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.  conference call information  to access the conference call, please dial 877-407-9221 for domestic callers or +1-201-689-8597 for international callers. when prompted, provide the conference identification number, 13644034.  if you are unable to participate, a replay of the conference call will be available for 30 days. the replay dial-in number for the united states is 877-660-6853 and the dial-in number for international callers is +1-201-612-7415. to access the replay you will need the conference identification number, 13644034.  about incyte  incyte corporation is a wilmington, delaware-based biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary therapeutics. for additional information on incyte, please visit the company’s website at www.incyte.com.  follow @incyte on twitter at https://twitter.com/incyte.  forward-looking statements  except for the historical information set forth herein, the matters set forth in this press release, including statements regarding the presentation and discussion of data regarding the company’s echo-202 study and the expected timetable for availability of initial data from its echo-301 study, contain predictions, estimates and other forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements are based on the company’s current expectations and subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including unanticipated developments and the risks related to the efficacy or safety of the company’s development pipeline, the results of further research and development, the high degree of risk and uncertainty associated with drug development, clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, other market or economic factors and competitive and technological advances;

arbutus reports interim multi-dose results from phase ii clinical trial of arb-1467 in patients with chronic hbv infection   single dose data demonstrate significant reduction in serum hbsag   additive reductions in serum hbsag observed with repeat dosing over 3 months     5 of 6 patients in cohort 1 had serum hbsag reductions of greater than 0.5 log(10) after 3 doses   additional multi-dose arb-1467 data expected in 4q16   company to host conference call today at 5 pm et to discuss results   vancouver, british columbia and doylestown, pa., sept. 29, 2016 (globe newswire) -- arbutus biopharma corporation (nasdaq:abus), an industry-leading hepatitis b virus (hbv) therapeutic solutions company, today reported interim results from the first two cohorts of the ongoing arb-1467 phase ii multi-dose clinical trial in chronically infected hbv patients.  the first two cohorts enrolled patients with hepatitis b e-antigen (hbeag) negative chronic hbv infection. at this time, serum hbsag data are available following single doses for both cohort 1 and cohort 2 and following multiple doses for cohort 1.   single dose arb-1467 results for cohorts 1 and 2 demonstrate significant reductions in serum hbsag levels. importantly, multiple dose results from cohort 1 show a step-wise, additive reduction in serum hbsag. these multiple dose results are the first of their kind for an rnai product candidate in patients with chronic hbv infection. treatment with arb-1467 has been generally well tolerated to date.                               single dose hbsag reduction         multiple dose hbsag reduction                              (log(10) iu/ml)                     (log(10) iu/ml)                   arb-1467             mean mean cohort    n        (mg/kg)   mean(a)   maximum(b)   maximum(c)   mean(a) maximum(b)   maximum(c) 1         6      0.2        -0.3      -0.4         -1.0         -0.6      -0.7         -1.3 2         6      0.4        -0.2      -0.3         -0.8         na        na         na  placebo   4(d)             0.0       0.0          -0.1         0.0       0.0         -0.1   (a) the mean serum hbsag reduction is the nadir value  of the arithmetic mean of all values observed at each  time point. (b) the mean maximum hbsag reduction is the mean of  each patient's maximum reduction in serum hbsag. (c) maximum hbsag reduction is the best single reduction  among all patients in a cohort. (d) single dose placebo results are based on four  subjects (two from each cohort). multiple dose placebo  results are based on the two placebo subjects in cohort  1.     "the interim arb-1467 data demonstrate significant serum hbsag reduction following the first dose, which is enhanced with repeat dosing. this is a very important finding because it suggests that even greater reductions in serum hbsag levels may be observed with continued dosing of arb-1467," said dr. douglas t. dieterich, professor of medicine in the division of liver disease at icahn school of medicine at mount sinai medical center. "these exciting data demonstrate the antiviral effect of arb-1467 and the potential to include this agent as a component of a combination therapy regimen for the treatment of chronic hbv infection."   "we are excited about these hbv efficacy data from our ongoing arb-1467 phase ii trial demonstrating substantial reductions in serum hbsag, which is an important first step towards one day curing chronic hbv infection. we believe that further study of arb-1467 will help determine the optimal protocol to produce maximal reductions in serum hbsag," said dr. mark j. murray, arbutus' president and ceo. "we plan to release additional multi-dose data later this year. we believe that ultimately curing hbv will require combination therapy and we are developing a portfolio of hbv assets with complementary mechanisms of action to accomplish this goal."   arb-1467 phase2 trial design   the phase ii trial is a multi-dose study in chronic hbv patients who are also receiving stable nucleot(s)ide analog therapy. the trial consists of three cohorts, each enrolling eight subjects; six receiving three monthly doses of arb-1467, and two receiving placebo. the first two cohorts include hbeag- patients, followed by a third cohort in hbeag+ patients.   about arb-1467   arbutus' rnai candidate arb-1467 comprises three rnai triggers that target all four hbv transcripts, and has been shown in preclinical studies to reduce all viral antigen levels as well as cccdna and hbv dna.  arb-1467 utilizes arbutus' proprietary lipid nanoparticle (lnp) platform, a clinically validated delivery technology which has been tested in hundreds of patients.   conference call today   arbutus will hold a conference call and webcast today, september 29, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. pacific time (5:00 p.m. eastern time) to provide interim results from the ongoing arb-1467 phase ii clinical trial. a live webcast of the call can be accessed through the investor section of arbutus' website at www.arbutusbio.com. or, alternatively, to access the conference call, please dial 1-914-495-8556 or 1-866-393-1607.   an archived webcast will be available on the arbutus website after the event. alternatively, you may access a replay of the conference call by calling 1-404-537-3406 or 1-855-859-2056 and referencing conference id 91182747.   about arbutus   arbutus biopharma corporation is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing a cure for patients suffering from chronic hbv infection.  arbutus is headquartered in vancouver, bc, canada with offices in doylestown, pa, usa. for more information, visit www.arbutusbio.com.   forward looking statements and information   this press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934, and forward looking information within the meaning of canadian securities laws (collectively, "forward-looking statements"). forward-looking statements in this press release include statements about possibly even greater reductions in serum hbsag levels with continued dosing of arb-1467; the potential to include arb-1467 as a component of a combination therapy regimen for the treatment of chronic hbv infection; determining the optimal protocol to produce maximal reductions in serum hbsag through further study of arb-1467; releasing additional multi-dose data later this year; and developing a portfolio of hbv assets to ultimately cure hbv through combination therapy.   with respect to the forward-looking statements contained in this press release, arbutus has made numerous assumptions regarding, among other things: the effectiveness and timeliness of clinical trials, and the usefulness of the data; the continued demand for arbutus' assets; and the stability of economic and market conditions. while arbutus considers these assumptions to be reasonable, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, market and social uncertainties and contingencies.   additionally, there are known and unknown risk factors which could cause arbutus' actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements contained herein. known risk factors include, among others: anticipated clinical trials may be more costly or take longer to complete than anticipated, and may never be initiated or completed, or may not generate results that warrant future development of the tested drug candidate; arbutus may not receive the necessary regulatory approvals for the clinical development of arbutus' products; economic and market conditions may worsen; and market shifts may require a change in strategic focus.   a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties facing arbutus appears in arbutus' annual report on form 10-k and arbutus' continuous disclosure filings, which are available at www.sedar.com and at www.sec.gov. all forward-looking statements herein are qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement, and arbutus disclaims any obligation to revise or update any such forward-looking statements or to publicly announce the result of any revisions to any of the forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect future results, events or developments, except as required by law.
genocea's genital herpes immunotherapy gen-003 demonstrates significant reduction of viral shedding in phase2b clinical trial   - trial achieves primary endpoint -   - dose confirmed for subsequent trials -   - phase3 expected to start in 2h 2017 -   - company to host conference call at 9 a.m. et today -   cambridge, mass., sept. 29, 2016 (globe newswire) -- genocea biosciences, inc. (nasdaq:gnca), a biopharmaceutical company developing t cell-directed vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive results from its ongoing phase2b trial evaluating a new phase3-ready formulation of gen-003 for the treatment of genital herpes. the study achieved its primary endpoint, with gen-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 40 percent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of matrix-m2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. the viral shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at the same time point in a prior phase2 trial.   "we are very encouraged by this positive data and have now selected a dose of 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of matrix-m2 of gen-003 for our planned phase3 trials. this is the third consecutive trial in which gen-003 has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral activity immediately post-dosing. in the previous phase2 trial, success in this measure translated into a significant impact on genital herpes clinical disease, durable to at least 12 months," said chip clark, president and chief executive officer of genocea. "this body of data supports our strong belief that gen-003 could be a cornerstone treatment for genital herpes. we look forward to reporting six-month placebo-controlled clinical data from this trial in january 2017 and expect to commence our phase3 program in the second half of 2017."   during the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of matrix-m2 dose of gen-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 40 percent reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate versus a marginal increase of 6 percent for placebo. the 60 ug per protein / 75 ug of matrix-m2 dose demonstrated a 27 percent reduction in the viral shedding rate. the topline viral shedding rate reductions for all of the dose groups in the trial are summarized in the following table:                   60 ug per protein /      60 ug per protein /                  50 ug of matrix-m2       75 ug of matrix-m2   placebo viral shedding  rate  reduction                 -40%                   -27%            +6% p-value vs.  baseline*                0.03                   0.16           0.76 p-value vs.  placebo*                 0.05                   0.20                 na       * statistical analysis performed using a modified poisson model (refined since phase2a trial with reference to advances in the field: magaret, amalia, "models for hsv shedding must account for two levels of overdispersion" (january 2016). uw biostatistics working paper series. working paper 410. http://biostats.bepress.com/uwbiostat/paper410)   safety in the trial was continuously reviewed by an independent data safety monitoring board. there was no grade 4 reactogenicity or related serious adverse events in this trial and discontinuations due to adverse events were low and similarly distributed across active dose groups and placebo.   "the established clinical profile of gen-003 is one that could be highly beneficial to patients looking for an effective treatment which potentially offers greatly improved convenience over daily oral antivirals, the only current treatment option for the millions of people suffering from genital herpes," said lori a. panther, m.d., mph, infectious diseases specialist at beth israel deaconess medical center and assistant professor of medicine at harvard medical school.  "i'm extremely encouraged by these results, once again demonstrating that gen-003 reduces viral shedding. control of viral shedding is fundamental to the control of genital herpes outbreaks and the epidemic spread of the disease."   about the gen-003 phase2b clinical trial   this phase2b trial is the first study testing potential phase3 endpoints with an improved formulation of gen-003 - manufactured with commercially-scalable processes - which will be used in future phase3 trials. the trial enrolled 131 subjects from 9 institutions in the united states. subjects have been randomized to one of three dose groups - placebo, 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of matrix-m2 and 60 ug per protein / 75 ug of matrix m2 - and have received three injections at 21-day intervals. viral shedding rate reductions were measured to demonstrate the efficacy of the new formulation. the study will also compare gen-003 efficacy to placebo for the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at six and 12 months after dosing. all subjects will be followed for 12 months after the last dose.   for more information about this clinical study of gen-003 please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.   conference call   genocea management will host a conference call and webcast today at 9 a.m. et to review this data. the conference call may be accessed by dialing (844) 826-0619 for domestic participants and (315) 625-6883 for international callers (reference conference id 87103963). a live webcast of the conference call will be available online from the investor relations section of the company's website at http://ir.genocea.com. a webcast replay of the conference call will be available on the genocea website beginning approximately two hours after the event, and will be archived for 30 days.   about gen-003   inducing a t cell response against genital herpes is critical to treating the clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the infection. gen-003 is a first-in-class t cell directed immunotherapy designed to elicit both a t cell and b cell (antibody) immune response. the immunotherapy was designed using genocea's atlas(tm) platform, which profiles the comprehensive spectrum of actual t cell responses mounted by humans in response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive t cell response. gen-003 includes the antigens icp4 and gd2 along with matrix-m2(tm)  auvant, which genocea licenses from novavax, inc. for more information about gen-003, please visit http://www.genocea.com/platform-pipeline/pipeline/gen003-for-genital-herpes/.     about genital herpes   genital herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes recurrent, painful genital lesions. it can be transmitted to sexual partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. current genital herpes therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a process which drives disease transmission. incomplete control of genital lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management. immunity through t cells is believed to be particularly critical to the control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.   about genocea   genocea is harnessing the power of t cell immunity to develop life-changing vaccines and immunotherapies. t cells are increasingly recognized as a critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases, but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets of such protective immune response. using atlas, its proprietary technology platform, genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid development of medicines to address critical patient needs. genocea's pipeline of novel clinical stage t cell-enabled product candidates includes gen-003 for genital herpes, gen-004 for the prevention of infection by all serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in cancer immunotherapy, chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis and malaria . for more information, please visit the company's website at www.genocea.com.     forward-looking statements   statements herein relating to future business performance, conditions or strategies and other financial and business matters, including expectations regarding clinical developments, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act. genocea cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements or historical experience include risks and uncertainties, including genocea's ability to progress any product candidates in preclinical or clinical trials;

regeneron announces phase2 study of aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab (anti-pdgfr-beta) shows no benefit over aflibercept alone in neovascular age-related macular degeneration   pr newswire   tarrytown, n.y., sept. 30, 2016   tarrytown, n.y., sept. 30, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: regn) today announced topline results from the phase2 capella study evaluating aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab, an anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (anti-pdgfr-beta) antibody, in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet amd). the combination therapy did not demonstrate an improvement in best corrected visual acuity (bcva) compared to intravitreal aflibercept injection monotherapy at 12 weeks, the primary endpoint of the study. at 12 weeks, patients in both combination aflibercept/rinucumab groups showed a 5.8 letter improvement in bcva. patients treated with aflibercept alone showed a 7.5 letter improvement in bcva.   "eylea(r) (aflibercept) injection is an established, effective therapy that has set a high bar in the treatment of wet amd," said george d. yancopoulos m.d., ph.d., chief scientific officer of regeneron and president of regeneron laboratories. "the addition of rinucumab did not improve on the efficacy of aflibercept alone. we are committed to continuing to innovate for patients with serious vision-threatening diseases, and look forward to the results of our ongoing combination studies of aflibercept and nesvacumab, an anti-angiopoietin 2 antibody, for which the preclinical data is more supportive."   eylea results in this study were consistent with the efficacy and safety seen in phase3 pivotal studies in wet amd. the efficacy results in the capella trial were consistent across all choroidal neovascularization (cnv) subtypes. adding rinucumab to aflibercept showed no benefit on anatomic endpoints including reduction in retinal thickness or in resolution of subretinal hyper-reflective material. ocular adverse events at 12 weeks were more common in the combination treatment groups (23.5 and 20 percent) compared to aflibercept alone (16 percent), primarily driven by an increase in conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation and eye pain.   the ongoing phase2, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose, regimen-ranging study has enrolled approximately 500 patients with wet amd. efficacy was evaluated using the early treatment diabetic retinopathy scale (etdrs) bcva. patients were randomized into one of three groups and received fixed doses every four weeks of either aflibercept monotherapy 2mg, aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 1mg or aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 3mg. the co-formulation was administered as a single intravitreal injection. at week 12, two of the three treatment groups were re-randomized, resulting in five total dosing groups in the second phase of the study. data will be evaluated at 28 weeks and again at 52 weeks, when the study is completed.   more detailed results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical congress.   important safety information for eylea(r) (aflibercept) injection   eylea(r) (aflibercept) injection is a prescription medication administered by injection into the eye. you should not use eylea if you have an infection in or around the eye, eye pain or redness, or known allergies to any of the ingredients in eylea, including aflibercept.   injection into the eye with eylea can result in an infection in the eye and retinal detachment (separation of retina from back of the eye). inflammation in the eye has been reported with the use of eylea.   in some patients, injections with eylea may cause a temporary increase in eye pressure within 1 hour of the injection. sustained increases in eye pressure have been reported with repeated injections, and your doctor may monitor this after each injection.   there is a potential risk of serious and sometimes fatal side effects related to blood clots, leading to heart attack or stroke in patients receiving eylea.   serious side effects related to the injection procedure with eylea are rare but can occur including infection inside the eye and retinal detachment.   the most common side effects reported in patients receiving eylea are increased redness in the eye, eye pain, cataract, moving spots in the field of vision, increased pressure in the eye, and vitreous (gel-like substance) detachment. it is important that you contact your doctor right away if you think you might be experiencing any side effects.   eylea is for prescription use only. for additional safety information, please talk to your doctor and see the full prescribing information for eylea.   please see the full us prescribing information for eylea at www.eylea.com. the product information is intended only for residents of the united states. the product discussed herein may have different labeling in different countries.   you are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the fda. visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-fda-1088.   about regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc.   regeneron (nasdaq: regn) is a leading science-based biopharmaceutical company based in tarrytown, new york that discovers, invents, develops, manufactures, and commercializes medicines for the treatment of serious medical conditions. regeneron commercializes medicines for eye diseases, high ldl cholesterol and a rare inflammatory condition and has product candidates in development in other areas of high unmet medical need, including rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, pain, cancer, and infectious diseases. for additional information about the company, please visit www.regeneron.com or follow @regeneron on twitter.   regeneron forward-looking statements and use of digital media   this news release includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties relating to future events and the future performance of regeneron pharmaceuticals, inc.

alnylam pharmaceuticals discontinues revusiran development   -- decision does not impact patisiran or any other rnai therapeutic program in development --   -- company to host conference call today at 5:00 p.m. et -- cambridge, mass.--(business wire)--october 05, 2016--   alnylam pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: alny), the leading rnai therapeutics company, announced today that upon the recommendation of the endeavour phase3 study data monitoring committee (dmc) to suspend dosing, the company has decided to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational rna interference (rnai) therapeutic that was being developed for the treatment of hereditary attr amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hattr-cm). this decision was made yesterday evening and has been communicated to investigators, study sites, and regulatory authorities.   following recent reports in the phase2 ole study of new onset or worsening peripheral neuropathy, the endeavour dmc assembled yesterday at the company's request to review these reports and endeavour data on an unblinded basis. the dmc did not find conclusive evidence for a drug-related neuropathy signal in the endeavour trial, but informed the company that the benefit-risk profile for revusiran no longer supported continued dosing. the company subsequently reviewed unblinded endeavour data which revealed an imbalance of mortality in the revusiran arm as compared to placebo.   "patient safety comes first. we have stopped all dosing and are actively monitoring patients across revusiran studies to ensure their safety. we will also continue to evaluate endeavour data to understand the potential cause of these findings," said john maraganore, ph.d., chief executive officer at alnylam. "while this outcome is disappointing given the lack of available treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disease, we remain committed to serving the needs of the attr amyloidosis community. we would like to thank patients, caregivers, investigators, and study staff who have been so supportive of the revusiran program."   the decision to discontinue development of revusiran does not affect patisiran, which is currently in phase3 development for the treatment of hattr amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hattr-pn), or any other alnylam investigational rnai therapeutic program in development.   based on a current assessment of the safety data across the company's other programs, which include the aln-pcssc program partnered with the medicines company, there is no evidence of a drug-related neuropathy signal in over 800 treated subjects and patients with exposure of up to 34 months. this includes patisiran, which utilizes a lipid nanoparticle delivery formulation, and the seven other clinical programs in alnylam's pipeline, which all use enhanced stabilization chemistry (esc) galnac delivery technology. esc-galnac conjugates enable dose and exposure levels that are 12-30 times lower than revusiran, which uses standard template chemistry (stc) galnac delivery technology. the company reaffirms its "alnylam 2020" guidance and remains committed to the advancement of these investigational rnai therapeutics for treatment of diseases with high unmet medical need.   if there are any questions regarding this announcement, please call the clinical trial information line at 866-330-0326 (toll-free within the us) or 617-575-7400 (international). alternatively, you may email any questions or comments to clinicaltrials@alnylam.com.   conference call information   alnylam management will discuss these developments in a webcast conference call on wednesday, october 5, at 5:00 p.m. et. a slide presentation will also be available on the investors page of the company's website, www.alnylam.com, to accompany the conference call. to access the call, please dial 877-312-7507 (domestic) or 631-813-4828 (international) five minutes prior to the start time and refer to conference id 94969575. a replay of the call will be available beginning at 8:00 p.m. et. to access the replay, please dial 855-859-2056 (domestic) or 404-537-3406 (international), and refer to conference id 94969575.   about attr amyloidosis   attr amyloidosis is a progressively debilitating and often fatal disease caused by deposition of transthyretin (ttr) in peripheral tissues. ttr protein is produced primarily in the liver and is normally a carrier of vitamin a. in hereditary attr amyloidosis (hattr), mutations in ttr cause abnormal amyloid proteins to accumulate and damage body organs and tissue, such as the peripheral nerves and heart, resulting in intractable peripheral sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy. hereditary attr amyloidosis represents a major unmet medical need with significant morbidity and mortality; hattr amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hattr-pn) -- also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (fap) -- affects approximately 10,000 people worldwide and hattr amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hattr-cm) -- also known as familial amyloidotic cardiomyopathy (fac) -- is estimated to affect at least 40,000 people worldwide. hattr-pn patients have a life expectancy of 5 to 15 years from symptom onset, and the only approved treatment options for early stage disease are liver transplantation and tafamidis (approved in europe, certain countries in latin america and japan, where it is approved for all stages of disease). hattr-cm is fatal within 2.5 to 5 years of diagnosis and treatment is currently limited to supportive care. wild-type attr amyloidosis (wtattr) -- previously called senile systemic amyloidosis (ssa) -- is a non-hereditary form of ttr cardiac amyloidosis caused by idiopathic deposition of wild-type ttr; its prevalence is generally unknown, but is associated with advanced age. there is a significant need for novel therapeutics to treat patients with attr amyloidosis.   sanofi genzyme alliance   in january 2014, alnylam and sanofi genzyme, the specialty care global business unit of sanofi, formed an alliance to accelerate and expand the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics across the world. the alliance is structured as a multi-product geographic alliance in the field of rare diseases. alnylam retains product rights in north america and western europe, while sanofi genzyme obtained the right to access certain programs in alnylam's current and future genetic medicines pipeline in the rest of the world (row) through the end of 2019, together with certain broader co-development/co-commercialization rights and global rights for certain products. in the case of patisiran, alnylam will advance the product in north america and western europe, while sanofi genzyme will advance the product in the row.   about galnac conjugates and enhanced stabilization chemistry (esc)-galnac conjugates   galnac-sirna conjugates are a proprietary alnylam delivery platform and are designed to achieve targeted delivery of rnai therapeutics to hepatocytes through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. alnylam's enhanced stabilization chemistry (esc)-galnac-conjugate technology enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide therapeutic index. this delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of alnylam's pipeline programs, including programs in clinical development.   about rnai   rnai (rna interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. its discovery has been heralded as "a major scientific breakthrough that happens once every decade or so," and represents one of the most promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded the 2006 nobel prize for physiology or medicine. rnai is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals. by harnessing the natural biological process of rnai occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as rnai therapeutics, is on the horizon. small interfering rna (sirna), the molecules that mediate rnai and comprise alnylam's rnai therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by potently silencing specific mrnas, thereby preventing disease-causing proteins from being made. rnai therapeutics have the potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.   about lnp technology   alnylam has licenses to arbutus biopharma lnp intellectual property for use in rnai therapeutic products using lnp technology.   about alnylam pharmaceuticals   alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rna interference, or rnai. the company is leading the translation of rnai as a new class of innovative medicines. alnylam's pipeline of investigational rnai therapeutics is focused in 3 strategic therapeutic areas (stars): genetic medicines, with a broad pipeline of rnai therapeutics for the treatment of rare diseases; cardio-metabolic disease, with a pipeline of rnai therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases; and hepatic infectious disease, with a pipeline of rnai therapeutics that address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases. in early 2015, alnylam launched its "alnylam 2020" guidance for the advancement and commercialization of rnai therapeutics as a whole new class of innovative medicines. specifically, by the end of 2020, alnylam expects to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 rnai therapeutic clinical programs -- including 4 in late stages of development -- across its 3 stars. the company's demonstrated commitment to rnai therapeutics has enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including ionis, novartis, roche, takeda, merck, monsanto, the medicines company, and sanofi genzyme. in addition, alnylam holds an equity position in regulus therapeutics inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microrna therapeutics. alnylam scientists and 
scynexis announces complete results from two phase2 studies of oral scy-078 in patients with candida spp. infections and closing of a $15 million term loan   study results confirm overall antifungal activity of oral scy-078 in patients with candida infections   well-tolerated and active oral dose of scy-078 identified for invasive candidiasis patients   evidence of efficacy and lower relapse rates versus standard of care in vvc patients   strong cash position to accelerate and expand development of scy-078 in multiple indications   jersey city, n.j., oct. 05, 2016 (globe newswire) -- drug development company scynexis, inc. (nasdaq:scyx) today announced the complete results of its two recently completed phase2 studies as well as the closing of a $15 million term loan with solar capital ltd. (nasdaq:slrc).   in the first study, treatment with oral scy-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc), resulted in significantly better clinical cure rates and fewer recurrences of vvc at the four-month follow-up when compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). in the second study, which evaluated oral scy-078 as a step down therapy in patients with invasive candidiasis, oral scy-078 achieved the target exposure for efficacy and was well-tolerated.   "we are delighted with these positive results that support the concept that a fungicidal product with high tissue penetration like scy-078 could yield superior clinical outcomes," said david angulo, m.d., chief medical officer of scynexis.  "we identified a well-tolerated oral dose that achieves our target exposure in invasive candidiasis patients, and further confirmed the antifungal activity of oral scy-078 in two independent human models of candida infections.  these results support our planned development of scy-078 as the first drug in a novel antifungal class for the treatment of a broad range of fungal infections with growing unmet medical needs."   phase2 proof-of-concept study of oral scy-078 in patients with vvc   the first study evaluated the effect of two dose regimens of scy-078 in patients with moderate to severe vvc as a proof-of-concept study to support the development of scy-078 in invasive candidiasis and other candida infections. clinical cure rate, defined as a resolution of signs and symptoms of infection without further antifungal treatment, is now the recommended primary endpoint per the latest fda guidelines for vvc. as previously reported, clinical cure rate was higher for patients receiving oral scy-078 compared to oral fluconazole at the test of cure visit (day 24).  additionally, follow-up data now available showed a high clinical cure rate at the four-month visit (end of observation period) of 88% in patients who received scy-078 compared to 65% in patients who received fluconazole (p=0.04). moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who received scy-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%).   phase2 study of oral scy-078 in patients with invasive candidiasis   the second study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (pk), safety, and tolerability of scy-078 as an oral step-down treatment in patients initially treated with intravenous (iv) echinocandin therapy for invasive candida infections.  twenty-two patients were randomized to receive study drug or standard of care (one of the patients randomized to standard of care could not receive oral fluconazole due to a candida glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility and received micafungin for the entire duration of antifungal therapy). as previously reported, the study met its primary objective by confirming the once daily oral dose of scy-078 750mg as a dose that is both overall safe and tolerated and achieves the target exposure in these patients. during the study period, there were no reports of mycological failures in the scy-078 750mg group (n=7) versus two infection-related failures (one fungemia and one abdominal sepsis) in the fluconazole group (n=7).  no relapses were observed in these two groups during the six-week follow-up period.   as previously reported, scy-078 was overall safe and tolerated in both studies. there were no discontinuations due to adverse events (aes) and no related serious aes. consistent with previous findings, the most common aes were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (gi) events such as diarrhea nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort. in patients with invasive candidiasis, the number of gi events were comparable in both the scy-078 and fluconazole treatment arms.   "we achieved our stated goals and further de-risked the development of our lead product candidate, scy-078," said marco taglietti, m.d., president and chief executive officer of scynexis. "with these positive phase2 data in hand, we believe scy-078 is now the most advanced novel agent in a new antifungal class that can address the growing issue of resistance. we are also pleased to announce the infusion of additional funds from solar capital, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to accelerate and expand the development of scy-078 and to leverage our internal antifungal platform."   additional capital raised   scynexis closed a $15 million term loan with solar capital, fully funded at close.  this transaction complements the company's recent equity raise, and results in minimal dilution to shareholders.  please refer to the form 8-k filing with the securities and exchange commission for additional information about the facility.   "solar capital is pleased to start a financing partnership with scynexis that should enable the company to expand its pipeline of indications for scy-078, as well as accelerate its other development programs," said anthony storino, head of life science lending at solar capital. "we believe scynexis offers a unique value proposition in an area with significant unmet medical needs, and we are excited to contribute to the company's growth and future successes."   as of september 30, 2016, scynexis' preliminary estimate of its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $58.4 million, including the $15 million from the loan facility.   armentum partners acted as financial advisor to scynexis on the loan facility.   about the studies   phase2 proof-of-concept study of oral scy-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc)   multicenter, randomized, active controlled, evaluator-blinded study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02679456) of oral scy-078 compared to oral fluconazole in adult female patients with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc). a total of 96 patients with an acute moderate to severe, symptomatic episode of vvc were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either three daily doses or five daily doses of oral scy-078 750mg qd with a 1,250mg loading dose or oral fluconazole, at the labeled approved dose regimen of 150mg single dose. this was a pilot investigation and not powered to demonstrate a statistical significant difference in the parameters tested (p values for the comparisons mentioned were >0.05 unless otherwise indicated). efficacy was evaluated based on the proportion of patients achieving clinical cure, mycological eradication and therapeutic cure (combination of both clinical cure and mycological eradication) at day 24 (+/-3) after initiation of treatment. the 3-day and the 5-day scy-078 regimens performed similarly, allowing a pooled analysis.  intent-to-treat (itt) population is defined as all subjects randomized (n=96 subjects). per-protocol (pp) population is defined as subjects with culture confirmed candida infection at baseline (n=70 subjects).  subjects in the pp population were followed for four months. recurrence was defined as a symptomatic vvc episode requiring additional antifungal therapy, per investigators' decision.   phase2 study of oral scy-078 in patients with invasive candidiasis   multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: nct02244606) following three to ten days of iv echinocandin therapy. a total of 27 patients with invasive candidiasis were enrolled and 22 were randomized to receive either scy-078 500mg qd with a 1,000mg loading dose (7 patients), scy-078 750mg qd with a 1,250mg loading dose (7 patients) or standard of care (7 patients receiving fluconazole 400mg qd with a 800mg loading dose and 1 patient receiving micafungin iv 100mg qd due to a candida glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility for up to 28 days). efficacy was assessed based on achievement of favorable global response defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms attributable to the candida infection and mycological eradication without the use of any other antifungal agent.  patients were followed for six weeks after the end of treatment.   about scy-078   scy-078 is an oral and iv glucan synthase inhibitor in phase2 clinical development for the treatment for fungal infections caused by candida and aspergillus species. scy-078 is a semi-synthetic triterpene derivative of the natural product enfumafungin--a structurally distinct class of glucan synthase inhibitor. scy-078 combines the well-established activity of glucan synthase inhibitors (similar to echinocandins) with the flexibility of having intravenous (iv) and oral formulations (similar to azoles). by belonging to a chemical class distinct from other antifungals, scy-078 has shown in vitro and in vivo activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens, including azole and echinocandin resistant strains. positive results from two recently reported phase2 studies provided evidence of the antifungal activity of orally administered scy-078 in patients with candida infections. the us food and drug administration (fda) granted fast track, qualified infectious disease product (qidp) and orphan drug designations (odd) for the oral and iv formulations of scy-078 for the indications of invasive candida infections (including candidemia) and invasive aspergillus infections.   about invasive candidiasis 
october 7, 2016 12:45:00 utc rucaparib nda dataset to be presented in oral presentation today at esmo rucaparib nda currently under priority review with fda prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) date is february 23, 2017 european marketing authorization application (maa) submission planned for q4 2016 clovis oncology (nasdaq:clvs) announced today the oral presentation of the primary efficacy and safety data from its nda dataset for rucaparib at the 2016 esmo congress in copenhagen. rucaparib is currently under priority review with fda for the monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with brca-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic brca mutations who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and the submission has a pdufa date of february 23, 2017.  rucaparib is the company’s oral, small molecule inhibitor of parp1, parp2 and parp3 currently being developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer, specifically in patients with tumors with brca mutations and other dna repair deficiencies beyond brca, including those with high genomic loss of heterozygosity (loh) also known as “brca-like." the current nda submission seeks approval in patients with tumor brca mutations, which includes both germline and somatic mutations.  “these results demonstrate that rucaparib may represent an important option for women with multiply relapsed brca-mutated ovarian cancer based on its encouraging efficacy and tolerability,” said rebecca s. kristeleit, md, phd, the university college london, cancer institute, london, uk. “in my opinion, rucaparib has the hallmarks of an important new therapeutic option for ovarian cancer patients.”  “we are pleased to present the primary efficacy and safety dataset that has been submitted to the fda as the basis of our nda for rucaparib in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. if approved, rucaparib would be the first parp inhibitor in the us indicated to treat ovarian cancer patients with germline or somatic brca mutations who have received two prior chemotherapies. women with brca mutations represent about 25% of patients in the us living with ovarian cancer,” said patrick j. mahaffy, ceo and president of clovis oncology. “our nda review is ongoing with fda, and in addition we are actively preparing for a european submission during the fourth quarter of 2016.”  data from subgroups of two multicenter, single-arm open-label phase2 studies, study 10 (nct01482715) and ariel2 (nct01891344) were combined for an integrated efficacy and safety analysis which further characterized the clinical benefit of rucaparib at the recommended starting dose of 600 mg bid in women with advanced ovarian cancer. in the two studies, 377 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the safety population (diagnosis of ovarian cancer and having received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib), and 106 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy population (received 2 or more prior chemotherapies, including 2 or more platinum-based regimens, had a mutation of brca (germline or somatic), and received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib.  the major efficacy outcome measure for this analysis was objective response rate (orr) and duration of response (dor) as assessed by the investigator according to recist. all responses were confirmed.  for the efficacy population (n=106), the median number of prior chemotherapies was three, with 39% having received two prior therapies and 61% of patients having received three or more prior therapies. the median number of prior platinum-based therapies was two, with 57% having received two prior platinum-based therapies, and 43% having received three or more prior platinum-based therapies. seventy-five percent of patients in the efficacy population were platinum-sensitive (as defined by recurrence after progression free interval (pfi) of ≥6 months), 19% were platinum resistant (recurrence after pfi <6 months) and 7% were platinum refractory (progression on platinum, pfi <2 months).  summary of efficacy data  the recist orr (objective response rate as assessed by the investigator, which includes complete and partial responses) in the efficacy population was 57/106, or 54% (95% ci: 43.8-63.5). this includes nine (9%) complete responders (cr) and 48 (45%) partial responders (pr). thirty-six patients (34%) had stable disease (sd) as the best response, while nine patients (9%) had progressive disease (pd) as the best response and four (4%) were not evaluable (ne). seventy-five of 106 patients, or 71% (95% ci: 61.1-79.2) had a recist or ca-125 response.  for the 42 patients from study 10 included in the efficacy population, the recist orr was 25/42, or 60% (95% ci: 43.3-74.4). this included four crs (10%) and 21 prs (50%). in addition, 12 patients (29%) had sd, two patients (5%) had pd and three (7%) were ne. for the 64 patients from ariel2 included in the efficacy population, the recist orr was 32/64, or 50% (95% ci: 37.2-62.8). this included five crs (8%) and 27 prs (42%). in addition, 24 patients (38%) had sd, seven (11%) had pd and one (2%) was ne. study 10 was limited to platinum sensitive patients; ariel2 included platinum sensitive, platinum resistant and platinum refractory patients.  in addition, orr was assessed by subgroups including brca mutation type, number of prior chemotherapies and prior platinum regimens, pfi and platinum status. patients with a brca1 (n=67) or brca2 (n=39) mutation both showed an orr of 54% (95% ci: 41.1-66.0, 37.2-69.9, respectively) in line with the overall population. the orr for patients with germline brca mutations (n=88) and somatic brca mutations (n=13) was 53% (95% ci: 42.5-64.1) and 46% (95% ci: 19.2-74.9), respectively; in addition, five patients with a brca mutation but unknown germline or somatic status had an orr of 80% (95% ci: 28.4-99.5). patients who received two prior chemotherapies (n=41) achieved an orr of 68% (95% ci: 51.9-81.9). patients who received two prior platinum regimens (n=60) demonstrated an orr of 65% (95% ci: 51.6-76.9). response by length of pfi differed for patients with pfi<6 months (n=27), 6-12 months (n=56) and greater than 12 months (n=23), reporting 19% (95% ci: 6.3-38.1), 63% (95% ci: 48.6-75.1) and 74% (95% ci: 51.6-89.8), respectively. response by platinum status was reported as 0% (95% ci: 0.0-41.0) for platinum-refractory patients (n=7), 25% (95% ci: 8.7-49.1) for platinum-resistant patients (n=20), and 66% (95% ci: 54.3-76.1) for platinum-sensitive patients (n=79).  duration of response by investigator assessment in the efficacy population was 9.2 months (95% ci: 6.6-11.7 months), and the censoring rate among responders was 47%. as of the cutoff dates, 20 patients with a recist response had an ongoing response.  additionally, analyses not contained within the nda submission showed median progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the efficacy population to be 10.0 months. of 106 patients, 50 patients did not have an event of disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. of these 50 patients, 32 patients were still on treatment, and 18 patients discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. of note, 79% of patients remained progression-free at six months, and 41% remained progression-free at 12 months.  for the efficacy dataset, the cut off dates were november 30, 2015 and february 29, 2016, for study 10 and ariel2, respectively.  summary of safety data  of the 377 ovarian cancer patients treated with a starting dose of rucaparib 600 mg, 377 (100%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (ae) of any grade, and 229 (61%) experienced a treatment-emergent ae grade 3 or higher. a total of 360 patients (96%) experienced a treatment-related ae of any grade, and 177 (47%) experienced a treatment-related ae that was grade 3 or higher. aes leading to dose interruption occurred in 221 patients (59%). treatment-related aes leading to dose reduction occurred in 167 patients (44%), and treatment discontinuation in 30 patients (8%). the primary reasons for dose reduction were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (17%), asthenia/fatigue (14%) and nausea (11%). the primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were asthenia/fatigue (2%), small intestinal obstruction (2%) and nausea (1%). nine patients (2%) had aes that led to death; eight were due to disease progression, and one death was due to sepsis, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.  the most common treatment-emergent aes (all grades) reported in ≥20 percent of patients included nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), increased alt/ast (41%) and constipation (40%). the most common grade 3/4 treatment-emergent aes reported in ≥10 percent of patients were anemia (25%), asthenia/fatigue (11%) and alt/ast elevations (11%).  the increases in aspartate (ast) and alanine (alt) aminotransferase levels that were observed were asymptomatic, reversible and were rarely associated with increases in bilirubin. the elevations normalized over time with continued rucaparib treatment.  mild to moderate creatinine elevations were observed within the first few weeks of treatment for most patients, for whom 79 (21%) experienced an ae, of whom two (0.5%) experienced a grade 3/4 event. these elevations in creatinine likely result from inhibition of the renal transporters mate1 and mate2-k, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine in the absence of renal injury.  myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia was reported in less than one percent of patients.  the cut-off dates for the safety dataset were march 31, 2016 for study 10 and april 29, 2016 for ariel2.

small molecule inhibitor of parp-1, parp-2 and parp-3 being developed for advanced ovarian cancer.  specifically, rucaparib is being developed as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with deleterious brca-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic brca mutations (as detected by an fda-approved test) who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. rucaparib was granted breakthrough therapy designation for this proposed indication by the us fda in april 2015; and in late june 2016, clovis completed its new drug application (nda) submission to the fda. the filing for treatment was accepted and has an action date of february 23, 2017. rucaparib’s marketing authorization application (maa) to the european medicines agency for the proposed treatment indication is planned for q4 2016.  foundation medicine, clovis’ companion diagnostic partner, has submitted a premarket approval (pma) application for its foundationfocus cdxbrca to the fda in june 2016. the test is designed to identify tumor brca mutations. the timing of the submission is expected to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic in a similar timeframe.  additionally, rucaparib is being developed as maintenance therapy in the ariel3 trial (nct01968213) for patients with tumors with brca mutations and other dna repair deficiencies beyond brca (commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies, or hrd). data from ariel3 are expected in q4 2017, which is expected to be followed by the submission of a supplemental nda for second-line maintenance therapy.  clovis is also exploring rucaparib in other solid tumor types with brca mutations or molecular evidence of the hrd signature, including prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.  clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib.  about ovarian cancer  according to the american cancer society, more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the us during 2016. there are often no clearly identifiable initial symptoms, and in an estimated 80 to 85% of ovarian cancer cases, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before a person is diagnosed and can be treated. ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. one in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic brca mutation, and new treatment options are needed to treat unique patient populations.  about clovis oncology  clovis oncology, inc. is a biopharmaceutical

tesaro and engot announce presentation of successful niraparib phase3 engot-ov16/nova trial results during esmo 2016    -- simultaneous presentation of data at esmo and publication online in the       new england journal of medicine      -- tesaro investor webcast to be held at 7:00 pm cet / 1:00 pm edt   copenhagen, oct. 08, 2016 (globe newswire) -- tesaro, inc. (nasdaq:tsro), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, and engot, the european network for gynaecological oncological trial groups, today announced the presentation of the niraparib phase3 engot-ov16/nova clinical trial results at the esmo 2016 congress, the congress of the european society for medical oncology (esmo), by dr. mansoor raza mirza, m.d., medical director of the nordic society of gynecologic oncology (nsgo) and principal investigator on the engot-ov16/nova trial. these data were discussed during the esmo press briefing in copenhagen as part of the congress, and were simultaneously published online in the new england journal of medicine.(1) the results will also be presented by dr. mirza later today during presidential symposium 1 (abstract #lba3_pr) at esmo.   an infographic accompanying this announcement is available at   http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/attachmentng/14546366-8c73-4d5b-a16b-bb37fcac1d06     engot-ov16/nova is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase3 trial of niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were in response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. this trial was designed to assess progression free survival (pfs) in a broad population of patients who were assigned to one of two cohorts based upon germline brca mutation status. the engot-ov16/nova trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint in both cohorts, demonstrating that niraparib treatment significantly prolonged pfs compared to control in patients who were germline brca mutation (gbrcamut) carriers and in patients who were not germline brca mutation (non-gbrcamut) carriers. in addition, within the non-gbrca cohort, niraparib treatment significantly prolonged pfs compared to control for the prospectively defined patient population with tumors deficient in homologous recombination (hrdpos) as determined by the myriad mychoice(r) hrd test. a high proportion of patients in both treatment groups in both cohorts had received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.   "these landmark results are extremely encouraging for the ovarian cancer community," said dr. mirza. "the effectiveness of platinum-based chemotherapy diminishes over time, and pfs and platinum-free intervals generally become shorter after each round of platinum treatment. in addition, the incidence of infection and risk of neuropathy and hypersensitivity with certain chemotherapy agents rises with subsequent cycles. an oral maintenance treatment that could lengthen the pfs interval between rounds of platinum-based chemotherapy would be very meaningful for patients with ovarian cancer, who often live with a fear of recurrence after ending active treatment."   "we would like to thank the patients, their families and the caregivers that participated in the engot-ov16/nova study, as well as our partners at engot for their diligence in executing this trial," said mary lynne hedley, ph.d., president and coo of tesaro. "we believe the results of this phase3 study demonstrated a meaningful benefit for women with platinum sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer."   primary endpoint results:   statistically significant pfs results in the gbrcamut cohort   among patients who were germline brca mutation carriers, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% ci, 0.173-0.410). the median pfs for patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared to 5.5 months for control (p<0.0001).   statistically significant pfs results in the non-gbrcamut cohort   niraparib showed statistical significance for patients in the non-germline brca mutant cohort. the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% ci, 0.338-0.607). the median pfs for patients treated with niraparib was 9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control (p<0.0001).   statistically significant pfs results in non-gbrcamut cohort for patients with hrd-positive tumors   for patients who were not germline brca mutation carriers but whose tumors were determined to be hrd positive using the myriad mychoice(r) hrd test, the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of pfs, with a hazard ratio of 0.38 (95% ci, 0.243-0.586). the median pfs for patients with hrd-positive tumors who were treated with niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for control (p<0.0001).   secondary endpoint results:   secondary endpoint analyses, including chemotherapy-free interval, time to first subsequent treatment, and pfs 2 were all statistically significant and favored niraparib over control for patients in both the gbrcamut and non-gbrcamut cohorts. patient-reported outcome results from validated survey tools indicated that niraparib-treated patients reported no difference from control in measures associated with quality of life. data for overall survival are immature (hr 0.73; 95% ci, 0.480 to 1.125; p=0.1545), as fewer than 20% of events had occurred at the time of analysis.   safety results:   the most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events in the niraparib arm were thrombocytopenia (33.8%), anemia (25.3%), and neutropenia (19.6%) with treatment discontinuation for these events of 3.3%, 1.4% and 1.9%, respectively. thrombocytopenia was not associated with grade 3/4 bleeding events. the majority of these hematological laboratory abnormalities occurred within the first three cycles; following dose modifications the incidence of these lab abnormalities decreased and thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were infrequent beyond cycle 3. the rates of mds/aml in the niraparib (1.4%) and control (1.1%) arms were similar. there were no deaths among patients during study treatment.   "despite diagnostic and treatment advances, ovarian cancer remains the deadliest gynecologic cancer, and the need for new therapeutic options that prolong response remains critical," said david barley, ceo of the national ovarian cancer coalition. "the results of the nova trial are encouraging, and could offer patients and their families a treatment option during the stressful period that follows platinum-based chemotherapy where the majority of patients receive no treatment."   investor briefing and webcast   tesaro will webcast an investor and analyst briefing in copenhagen on saturday, october 8 at 7:00 pm local time in copenhagen in conjunction with the esmo annual meeting. at this briefing, tesaro management will review the niraparib development program and data presented at esmo and answer questions from investors and analysts. this event will be webcast live and archived for 30 days, and may be accessed from the tesaro investor events and presentations webpage at www.tesarobio.com.  a reception will begin at 6:30 pm local time for those institutional investors and analysts attending this event in copenhagen; please rsvp to krausch@tesarobio.com in order to attend.   about the phase3 engot-ov16/nova clinical trial of niraparib   nova is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international phase3 trial of niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. patients were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline brca mutation status. one cohort enrolled patients who were germline brca mutation carriers (gbrcamut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who were not germline brca mutation carriers (non-gbrcamut) and included patients with hrd-positive and hrd-negative tumors. within each cohort, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo and were treated continuously with placebo or 300 milligrams of niraparib, dosed as three 100 milligram tablets once per day, until progression. the primary endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (pfs). secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, chemotherapy-free interval length, pfs 2, overall survival, and other measures of safety and tolerability.  more information about this trial is available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/nct01847274.   about niraparib   niraparib is an oral, once-daily parp inhibitor that is currently being evaluated in four ongoing pivotal trials. tesaro is building a robust niraparib franchise by assessing activity across multiple tumor types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. the ongoing development program for niraparib includes a phase3 trial in patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer (the nova trial); a phase3 trial in patients with first-line ovarian cancer (the prima trial); a registrational phase2 treatment trial in patients with ovarian cancer (the quadra trial); and a phase3 trial for the treatment of patients with brca-mutant breast cancer (the bravo trial). several combination studies are also underway, including trials of niraparib plus pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. janssen biotech has licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in japan. 
cmx157 demonstrates 99% viral load reduction in ongoing head-to-head phase2a clinical study vs. viread(r) in hepatitis b patients   study achieves proof of concept for cmx157 in hbv patients with favorable therapeutic profile   pr newswire   edison, n.j., oct. 13, 2016   edison, n.j., oct. 13, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- contravir pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: ctrv), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today reported positive interim data for cmx157, the company's highly potent prodrug of tenofovir, from its ongoing phase2a multiple ascending dose clinical study.  the head-to-head study is the first evaluation of cmx157 in hbv patients, and directly compares cmx157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf, gilead's viread(r) ) in chronically infected hepatitis b (hbv) patients.   patients successfully completed both 5 mg and 10 mg cohorts, and interim data reported below are from 10 hbv-infected patients who completed 14 days of once-a-day oral dosing of 25 mg of cmx157, and two hbv patients treated for 14 days of oral dosing with 300 mg tdf.  the cmx157 treated patients showed an average 99% reduction in hbv viral load compared to baseline. significantly, the observed antiviral activity for cmx157 is comparable to that observed in tdf-treated patients, but at 1/12(th) the dose (25 mg cmx157 vs. standard 300 mg tdf).   a key goal of this study was to monitor levels of active tenofovir in the blood, exposure to which is a key predictor of off-target side effects. following oral dosing, levels of cmx157 and active tenofovir in the bloodstream are approximately dose proportional and similar both in chronic hbv patients as well as in an earlier healthy volunteer study. notably, cmx157 does not appear to break down readily into active tenofovir in the blood (tenofovir: cmax = 2.8 ng/ml; auc = 34 ng*h/ml) in contrast to patients taking viread(r) (tenofovir: cmax 340 ng/ml, auc 1910 ng*h/ml). the high levels of circulating tenofovir in subjects taking viread(r) are consistent with results from earlier published clinical studies of viread(r) in hiv and hbv patients.  these results are significant considering that cmx157 achieved similar antiviral activity compared to viread(r) while significantly reducing systemic tenofovir exposure.   active tenofovir levels observed in blood following oral dosing of cmx157 are significantly below levels seen for viread(r) -treated patients, regardless of dose used, which is consistent with cmx157 targeting the liver followed by activation of cmx157 specifically within the liver.  this is further supported by the observation that viral load reductions with cmx157 are comparable to viread(r) despite a significantly lower dose.   "we are pleased and excited with these clinical results, as they demonstrate cmx157's great potential in our ongoing effort to develop a cure for hbv," said james sapirstein, ceo of contravir.  "the significant viral load reduction and favorable safety at this low dose of cmx157 speaks to the unique liver-targeting mechanism of our drug, which concentrates the antiviral activity of tenofovir in the liver, enabling anti-hbv efficacy at lower doses and minimal drug exposure to other tissues.  we believe, based on the data that are being generated, that cmx157 has great potential as a safe and highly potent backbone of combination therapy against hbv."   pharmacokinetic data observed for cmx157 to date in healthy and hbv-infected subjects are similar across the completed phase1b and ongoing phase2a studies, consistent with the prodrug's site of action and anticipated improved safety profile.  cmx157 was earlier found to be safe and well tolerated at daily oral doses of up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers and is presently demonstrating an excellent safety profile at 25 mg dose in the ongoing phase2a study in hbv patients.  upon completion of the 4-week dosing regimen and independent safety review, dose escalation is planned to continue at the 50 mg and 100 mg levels, respectively.  similarity of pharmacokinetic profiles observed for cmx157 in healthy and hbv-infected subjects strongly suggests that the remaining 50 mg and 100 mg doses of cmx157 in the ongoing phase2a study will also be safe and potentially even more active against hbv.   cmx157 phase2 clinical trial design   the phase2a multiple ascending dose clinical trial is designed to enroll 60 treatment-na&#239;ve patients with chronic hbv infection, and to compare cmx157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (tdf, gilead's viread(r) ).  the sequential dose escalation format consists of 10 patients per cohort receiving four weeks of a once-daily dose of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg, respectively, of cmx157, plus two patients per cohort receiving 300 mg of tdf, the standard therapeutic dose of viread(r) .   about cmx157   cmx157 is a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir.  its novel liver-targeting structure results in decreased circulating levels of tenofovir, lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential for renal side effects.  cmx157 previously completed a phase1b dose escalation clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, in which participants were treated at doses up to 100 mg per day for 14 days, displaying an excellent safety, tolerability, and drug distribution profile.  based on cmx157's best-in-class potential, contravir believes cmx157 can become the cornerstone of a curative combination therapy for hepatitis b.   about contravir pharmaceuticals   contravir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis b virus (hbv). the company is developing two novel anti-hbv compounds with complementary mechanisms of action: cmx157, a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir currently in a phase2a clinical trial in hbv patients; and crv431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against hbv. contravir is also developing fv-100, an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, in a phase3 clinical trial. in addition to direct antiviral activity, fv-100 previously demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (phn) in a phase2 clinical study. for more information visit www.contravir.com.   forward looking statements   certain statements in this press release are forward-looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. these statements may be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as "anticipate," "believe," "forecast," "estimated" and "intend," among others. these forward-looking statements are based on contravir's current expectations and actual results could differ materially. there are a number of factors that could cause actual events to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. these factors include, but are not limited to, substantial competition;

the medicines company announces positive topline results from day 90 interim analysis in ongoing orion-1 phase2 study of pcsk9si   -- compelling efficacy and safety data from orion-1 interim analysis confirm results up to day 90 from pcsk9si phase1 study and significantly exceed orion-1 study objectives --   -- pcsk9si again demonstrated significant and durable ldl-c reduction-with even greater statistical robustness-reaffirming triannual and potentially biannual dosing regimen --   -- pcsk9si continues to demonstrate high standards of safety and tolerability--   -- data from orion-1 affirm pcsk9si's highly-competitive profile --   -- detailed results, including day 90 follow-up for all 501 patients and topline data from preliminary analysis of day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, will be presented in late-breaking clinical trial session at american heart association meeting on november 15, 2016 -- parsippany, n.j.--(business wire)--october 18, 2016--   the medicines company (nasdaq:mdco) today announced topline results from the interim analysis with day 90 follow-up for all 501 patients enrolled in the ongoing orion-1 study of pcsk9si, its investigational first-in-class pcsk9 synthesis inhibitor. data from the interim analysis confirm the significant and durable ldl-c reduction demonstrated up to day 90 in the preceding phase1 study. pcsk9si was well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed in the day 90 interim analysis of unblinded safety data, including no investigational drug-related elevation of liver enzymes, neuropathy or change in renal function. injection site reactions were infrequent, mild or moderate, and short-lived.   "we are highly encouraged by the strength and consistency of the day 90 efficacy and safety data from orion-1, which build significantly on the promise generated by the preceding phase1 study of pcsk9si," said clive meanwell, m.d., ph.d., chief executive officer of the medicines company. "these compelling interim data affirm pcsk9si's highly-competitive profile and validate pcsk9si's game-changing potential. we look forward to presenting results from the orion-1 study, including day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, at the aha meeting on november 15, 2016."   david kallend, mbbs, vice president and global medical director at the medicines company, added, "based on the results from our orion-1 day 90 interim analysis, pcsk9si has again demonstrated robust and durable knockdown of ldl-c, as well as impressive safety and tolerability. these results validate a triannual, and potentially biannual, low volume subcutaneous dose regimen, which we believe represents a compelling, highly-differentiated approach for treating patients with hypercholesterolemia."   "the thoughtful and robust design of the orion-1 study has delivered highly impressive interim data," said john j.p. kastelein, m.d., ph.d., professor of medicine and chairman of the department of vascular medicine at the academic medical center of the university of amsterdam. "the potential for management of hypercholesterolemia with two or three low volume injections per year could open a new, transformative and affordable pathway for patients and physicians in the treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease."   the interim analysis of day 90 follow-up for all 501 patients, as well as topline data from day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, will be presented in a late-breaking clinical trials session at the aha scientific sessions 2016 on november 15, 2016 in new orleans. in order to protect the scientific integrity of the ongoing orion-1 study, the company does not expect to provide additional information or make further public statements regarding the results of the study in advance of the orion-1 presentation at the aha scientific sessions. the company anticipates that data from day 180 follow-up in all 501 patients will be completed, analyzed and topline results disclosed before the end of 2016.   about orion-1   orion-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, dose-finding phase2 trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of pcsk9si in a total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) or ascvd-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated ldl-c despite maximum tolerated doses of ldl-c lowering therapies. the trial compares the effect of different doses of pcsk9si and evaluates the potential for dosing no more than two, three or four times per year.   about pcsk9si (also known as aln-pcssc)   pcsk9si is an investigational proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (pcsk9) synthesis inhibitor, which acts via rna interference, being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. pcsk9 is a genetically-validated protein regulator of ldl receptor metabolism. in contrast to anti-pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that bind to pcsk9 in blood, pcsk9si is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by inhibiting pcsk9 synthesis in the liver.   in a previous, single-ascending dose study, pcsk9si was associated with maximal pcsk9 knockdown of 88.7 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0 percent and maximal ldl-c reduction of 78.1 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0 percent. at day 180, a single dose of pcsk9si was associated with an up to 53 percent reduction in ldl-c, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0 percent in the 300 mg dose cohort.   in a previous multiple ascending dose study, pcsk9si was associated with maximal pcsk9 knockdown of 94.4 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6 percent and maximal ldl-c reduction of 83.0 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4 percent.   pcsk9si was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   the medicines company and alnylam pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the advancement of pcsk9si per their agreement formed in early 2013. under the terms of the agreement, alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the phase1 clinical study, with the medicines company leading and funding the development of pcsk9si from phase2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.   about the medicines company   the medicines company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose--to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. the company's mission is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in three critical therapeutic areas: serious infectious disease care, cardiovascular care and surgery and perioperative care. the company is headquartered in parsippany, new jersey, with global innovation centers in california and switzerland.   forward looking statements   statements contained in this press release that are not purely historical may be deemed to be forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. without limiting the foregoing, the words "believes, " "anticipates," "expects," "potential," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause the company's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. important factors that may cause or contribute to such differences include whether clinical trials for our product candidates, including the orion-1 study of pcsk9si, will advance in the clinical process on a timely basis, or at all, or succeed in achieving their specified endpoints;

october 20, 2016 20:00:00 utc –– once-daily alks 5461 significantly improved depression scores in patients with inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies ––  –– company to request meeting with fda to discuss next steps for potential regulatory submission ––  –– management to hold conference call today at 5:00 p.m. edt ––  alkermes plc (nasdaq: alks) today announced positive topline results from forward-5, the third phase3 efficacy study to read out from the forward pivotal program for alks 5461, a once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action for the aunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (mdd) in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. the study met its prespecified primary endpoint showing treatment with alks 5461 significantly reduced symptoms of depression in patients with mdd compared to placebo. alks 5461 was generally well tolerated. the most common adverse events observed for alks 5461 were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. based on these results, along with the substantial data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of alks 5461 for the treatment of mdd, the company plans to request a meeting with the us food and drug administration’s (fda) division of psychiatric products to discuss the filing strategy for this fast track designated medicine.  “we designed alks 5461 to have a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of mdd, a serious disease where new therapeutic options are highly sought after as millions of patients in the us do not respond to standard courses of antidepressant therapy,” said elliot ehrich, m.d., chief medical officer of alkermes. “with the successful completion of the forward-5 study and data from more than 1,500 patients to date, we have established a strong foundation of evidence of alks 5461’s clinical utility in the aunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. with these data now in hand, we will move forward rapidly to meet with the fda to determine the appropriate next steps toward a regulatory submission for alks 5461, with a goal of bringing this important new medication to patients with mdd.”  “alks 5461 embodies our dedication to developing novel and safe cns medicines that address compelling unmet needs faced by large numbers of patients,” said richard pops, chief executive officer of alkermes. “major depressive disorder affects millions of people and their families, and represents one of the greatest burdens of suffering and cost of any disease today. new drug development in the field is challenging and we are excited to advance alks 5461 in this important indication.”  in the study, alks 5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale (madrs-6) scores (p=0.018). alks 5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item madrs (madrs-10) scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). the 1mg/1mg dose of alks 5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.  the most commonly reported adverse events for alks 5461 in the forward-5 study were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. these findings are consistent with those observed in previously reported studies of alks 5461. alkermes will present comprehensive data from forward-5 at an upcoming medical meeting and submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.  about the forward-5 study forward-5 was a phase3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (spcd) study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two dose levels of alks 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg) as aunctive treatment in patients with mdd who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (snri). the study randomized 407 subjects.  the study was conducted in two sequential stages: stage 1 was 5 weeks in duration, stage 2 was 6 weeks. in stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. for stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. the results of stages 1 and 2 were then averaged. depression scores were assessed using the 6-item montgomery–Åsberg depression rating scale (madrs-6) and madrs-10. madrs-6, a subscale of the madrs-10 assessment tool for depression, focuses on the core symptoms of depression.  about the forward clinical program the forward (focused on results with a rethinking of depression) pivotal program for alks 5461 includes three core phase3 efficacy studies, as well as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing, pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of alks 5461. forward-5 is the third phase3 efficacy study to read out from the forward program. results from forward-3 and forward-4 were announced in january 2016 and detailed data were presented at the american society of clinical psychopharmacology (ascp) in june 2016.  conference call alkermes will host a conference call on thursday, oct. 20, 2016 at 5:00 p.m. edt (10:00 p.m. bst). the conference call may be

- second positive phase3 study provides further evidence of spinraza’s efficacy and favorable safety profile -  - results were statistically significant and clinically meaningful -  biogen (nasdaq:biib) and ionis pharmaceuticals (nasdaq:ions) announced that spinrazatm (nusinersen), an investigational treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (sma), met the primary endpoint at the interim analysis of cherish, the phase3 study evaluating spinraza in later-onset (consistent with type 2) sma. the analysis found that children receiving spinraza experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. spinraza demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study.  this smart news release features multimedia. view the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161107005392/en/  “these results, along with our successful trial in infantile-onset sma, reinforce the potential of spinraza to benefit a broad range of sma patients,” said michael ehlers, m.d., ph.d., executive vice president, head of research and development at biogen. “we will make regulators around the globe aware of this data and will continue working closely with them to bring spinraza to families affected by sma as quickly as possible.”  biogen is preparing for the potential launch of spinraza in the us possibly as early as the end of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.  results from the cherish interim analysis  cherish is a fifteen-month study investigating spinraza in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset sma (consistent with type 2), including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening.  results from the primary endpoint of the pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a difference of 5.9 points (p= 0.0000002) at 15 months between the treatment (n=84) and sham-controlled (n=42) study arms, as measured by the hammersmith functional motor scale expanded (hfmse). from baseline to 15 months of treatment, patients who received spinraza achieved a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the hfmse, while patients who were not on treatment declined by a mean of 1.9 points. the hfmse is a reliable and validated tool specifically designed to assess motor function in children with sma, and a change of three points or greater in the hfmse has previously been identified as clinically meaningful. data from the other endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. spinraza demonstrated a favorable safety profile. the majority of the adverse events were considered to be either related to sma disease, common events in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. no patients discontinued the study.  with the positive interim analysis, the cherish study will be stopped and participants will be able to transition into the shine open-label extension study to receive spinraza. full study results will be presented at future medical congresses.  “these data further validate the potential of spinraza as a treatment for patients with sma,” said b. lynne parshall, chief operating officer of ionis pharmaceuticals. “we are grateful to all the families and clinicians who have participated in all of the spinraza studies. without their commitment and support, this program would not have been able to progress so quickly.”  the us food and drug administration (fda) recently accepted the company’s new drug application (nda) for spinraza as a treatment for sma and communicated they plan to act early on the nda under an expedited review. additionally, the european medicines agency (ema) recently validated biogen’s marketing authorization application (maa) in the eu. the ema’s committee for medicinal products for human use (chmp) granted accelerated assessment status and the fda granted priority review to spinraza. biogen is initiating regulatory filings in other countries in the coming months.  biogen initiated a global expanded access program (eap) in infantile-onset sma earlier this year. the company will continue to explore where and when the eap may be broadened to include patients with later-onset sma (consistent with type 2).  the spinraza clinical trial program  spinraza has been studied in both presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with sma including patients likely to develop or diagnosed with sma types 1, 2, and 3.  the spinraza phase3 program is comprised of two registrational studies, endear and cherish. endear is a thirteen-month study investigating spinraza in 122 patients with infantile-onset sma, including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms of sma at up to six months of age. the endpoint pre-specified for the interim analysis of the study evaluated the proportion of motor milestone responders from the motor component of the hammersmith infant neurological examination (hine). given the results of the positive interim analysis, the endear study is being stopped and participants are able to transition into the shine open-label study, in which all patients will receive spinraza.  additionally, the shine open-label extension study for patients who previously participated in endear or cherish is open and is intended to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of spinraza.  two additional phase2 studies, embrace and nurture, were designed to collect additional data on spinraza. embrace is studying a small subset of patients with infantile or later-onset sma who do not meet the age and other criteria of endear or cherish. nurture is an open-label, ongoing study in pre-symptomatic infants who are up to six weeks of age at time of first dose to determine if treatment before symptoms begin would prevent or delay the onset of sma symptoms. an interim analysis of nurture showed that infants treated for up to one year with spinraza achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with type 1 sma. three infants experienced adverse events considered possibly related to spinraza, all of which resolved. in addition, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study and no new safety concerns have been identified. nurture is currently active and enrolling. all studies are being conducted on a global scale.  about sma1-5  spinal muscular atrophy (sma) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of sma can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.  due to a loss of, or defect in the smn1 gene, people with sma do not produce enough survival motor neuron (smn) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. the severity of sma correlates with the amount of smn protein. people with type 1 sma, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little smn protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. people with type 2 and type 3 produce greater amounts of smn protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of sma.  currently, there is no approved treatment for sma.  to support awareness and education in sma, biogen has launched together in sma in the united states. together in sma is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the sma community. learn more at www.togetherinsma.com.  about spinraza (nusinersen)  spinraza is an investigational, potentially disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of sma that was discovered and developed by ionis pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics. spinraza is an antisense oligonucleotide (aso) that is designed to alter the splicing of smn2, a gene that is nearly identical to smn1, in order to increase production of fully functional smn protein.7  asos are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target rna and regulate gene expression. through use of this technology, spinraza has the potential to increase the amount of functional smn protein in infants and children with sma.  both the us and eu have granted spinraza orphan drug status. additionally, both the us and eu regulatory agencies have granted special status to spinraza, including fast track designation and priority review in the us and accelerated assessment in the eu.  biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to spinraza in august 2016.  biogen and ionis pharmaceuticals acknowledge support from the following organizations for spinraza: cure sma, muscular dystrophy association, and sma foundation, intellectual property licensed from cold spring harbor laboratory and the university of massachusetts medical school.  about biogen  through cutting-edge science and medicine, biogen discovers, develops and delivers worldwide innovative therapies for people living with

the medicines company and alnylam pharmaceuticals present positive results from orion-1 phase2 study of inclisiran (formerly pcsk9si)   --study meets all interim analysis goals--   --a single injection of inclisiran (300 mg) lowered 'bad cholesterol' (ldl-c) by an average of 51%, and up to 76%--   --two injections of inclisiran (300 mg) lowered ldl-c by an average of 57% and up to 81%--   --significant ldl-c reductions were sustained out to 180 days following a single dose--   --potential for highly-differentiated, infrequent, low volume dosing regimen of 2 or 3 injections per year affirmed--   --inclisiran demonstrated highly encouraging safety and tolerability--   --based on the strength of the orion-1 data, the medicines company expects to advance inclisiran aggressively in a global phase3 development program--     --conference call to be held at 3:00 p.m., eastern time, today-- parsippany, n.j. &amp; cambridge, mass.--(business wire)--november 15, 2016--   the medicines company (nasdaq:mdco) and alnylam pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq:alny) today announced positive results from the analysis of day 90 data for 497 patients, as well as analysis of preliminary day 180 data for 189 patients, enrolled in the orion -1 phase2 study of inclisiran. data from orion-1 were presented today in a late-breaking clinical trials session at the american heart association scientific sessions 2016 in new orleans.   inclisiran (formerly known as pcsk9si or aln-pcssc) is an investigational galnac-conjugated rnai therapeutic targeting pcsk9--a genetically validated protein regulator of ldl receptor metabolism--being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.   inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was observed, including no elevations of liver enzymes considered related to study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function. overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 54% both in patients randomized to placebo and in patients randomized to inclisiran, with no differences between inclisiran doses. injection site reactions (isrs) with inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 3.2% of patients), mild or moderate, and transient - in only 2.4% of patients, the reported isr started or was still present 4 or more hours after dosing.   baseline ldl-c was approximately 130 mg/dl among 497 randomized and treated patients. among these patients, one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean ldl-c reductions of 51% at day 60, which were durable to day 90 (mean 45% and up to 76%). all differences relative to placebo in these 497 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).   among 189 randomized and treated patients who had been followed for 180 days or more by the interim data cut-off date of october 25, 2016, one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean ldl-c reductions of 59% at day 60, which were durable to day 90 (mean 50%) and day 180 (mean 43% and up to 81%). two 300 mg injections of inclisiran - one given on day 1 and one on day 90 - achieved a mean ldl-c reduction of 57% at day 120, which was durable to day 180 (mean 52% and up to 81%). all differences relative to placebo in these 189 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).   "the remarkable strength and consistency of the data from orion-1 provide compelling support for the medical and commercial potential of inclisiran and drive our decision to move into phase3 with what we believe could be a highly-competitive and potentially transformational medicine," said clive meanwell, m.d., ph.d., chief executive officer of the medicines company. "we will focus our resources on inclisiran for aggressive phase3 development to ensure that this promising agent is investigated thoroughly and rapidly in phase3, submitted to worldwide regulatory agencies and, if approved, made available to millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who continue to grapple with the realities and risks of high ldl-c."   david kallend, mbbs, vice president and global medical director of the medicines company, added, "these positive results from orion-1 showed robust and durable knockdown of ldl-c and a very encouraging safety and tolerability profile at this stage of development. the data strengthen our earlier findings in phase1 - published recently in the new england journal of medicine - that an infrequent, low volume dosing regimen of 2 or 3 injections per year could constitute a highly-differentiated and competitive treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. inclisiran also has the potential to open new care approaches linking the temporal cycle of ldl-c monitoring with counseling and administration of therapy. the orion-1 data have enabled us to select an optimal dose of 300 mg, and the data presage a quick and efficient transition to phase3 development."   john j.p. kastelein, m.d., ph.d., professor of medicine and chairman of the department of vascular medicine at the academic medical center (amc) of the university of amsterdam, said, "elevated ldl-c remains a major risk factor for coronary artery disease, and new therapies are needed for patients who are refractory or intolerant to current approaches for management of their ldl-c levels. pcsk9 therapies have now emerged as a new class of drugs for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and i believe that these agents have the potential to make a meaningful difference for patients. orion-1 strengthens prior data with inclisiran, especially the degree and durability of ldl-c lowering effects. if the safety and efficacy of this novel investigational pcsk9 synthesis inhibitor can be confirmed in phase3 studies to support approval, it may offer an important treatment option for patients, physicians, and payers."   john maraganore, ph.d., chief executive officer of alnylam, added, "we are delighted with these data from the orion development program for inclisiran and thankful for the progress made by investigators and our partner, the medicines company. we are very excited to see the rapid progression of the program worldwide and are confident that our rnai platform provides the opportunity to create new medicines for important diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, which have major unmet medical needs."   conference call and webcast details   the medicines company will host a conference call and

total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ascvd) or ascvd-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated ldl-c despite maximum tolerated doses of ldl-c lowering therapies. the study compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. the primary endpoint of the study is the percentage change in ldl-c from baseline at day 180.   about inclisiran   inclisiran (formerly known as pcsk9si or aln-pcssc) is an investigational galnac-conjugated rnai therapeutic targeting pcsk9 -- a genetically validated protein regulator of ldl receptor metabolism -- being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. in contrast to anti-pcsk9 monoclonal antibodies (mabs) that bind to pcsk9 in blood, inclisiran is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off pcsk9 synthesis in the liver.   in a previous, single-ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal pcsk9 knockdown of 88.7% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0% and maximal ldl-c reduction of 78.1% with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0%. at day 180, a single dose of inclisiran was associated with an up to 53% reduction in ldl-c, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0% in the 300 mg dose cohort.   in a previous multiple ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal pcsk9 knockdown of 94.4% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6% and maximal ldl-c reduction of 83.0% with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4%.   inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   the medicines company and alnylam pharmaceuticals, inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran per the companies' agreement formed in early 2013. under the terms of the agreement, alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the phase1 clinical study, with the medicines company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from phase2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.   about the medicines company   the medicines company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose--to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the

lilly announces topline results of solanezumab phase3 clinical trial   canada newswire   indianapolis, nov. 23, 2016   indianapolis, nov. 23, 2016 /cnw/ -- eli lilly and company (nyse: lly) today announced that solanezumab did not meet the primary endpoint in the expedition3 clinical trial, a phase3 study of solanezumab in people with mild dementia due to alzheimer's disease (ad).   patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with placebo (p=.095), as measured by the adas-cog(14) (alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale).   while the study results, including many secondary clinical endpoints, directionally favored solanezumab, the magnitudes of treatment differences were small. there were no new safety signals identified in the study. lilly will not pursue regulatory submissions for solanezumab for the treatment of mild dementia due to alzheimer's disease.   "the results of the solanezumab expedition3 trial were not what we had hoped for and we are disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a potential disease-modifying treatment for alzheimer's disease," said john c. lechleiter, ph.d., chairman, president and chief executive officer, lilly. "we will evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for solanezumab and our other alzheimer's pipeline assets."   lilly will work with investigators to appropriately conclude the open-label extensions for expedition, expedition2 and expedition3. the next steps for the remaining elements of the solanezumab development program have not yet been determined.   "lilly is grateful for the dedication of the patients, their families, and the clinical investigators who participated in this study," said jan lundberg, ph.d., executive vice president of science and technology and president of lilly research laboratories. "lilly remains committed to alzheimer's research as we have been for nearly 30 years, and our portfolio includes many other promising approaches."   lilly will present further findings from the study at the clinical trials on alzheimer's disease (ctad) meeting on thursday, december 8(th) at 9:15 p.m. et. the presentation will be shared live via webcast from the meeting. to access the webcast, please visit http://www.ctad-alzheimer.com.   "lilly has strong growth prospects without solanezumab," said david a. ricks, lilly's incoming chief executive officer and president of lilly bio-medicines. "driven by new product launches, we continue to expect to grow average annual revenue by at least 5 percent between 2015 and 2020. over that time frame, we also expect to increase our margins and provide annual dividend increases to our shareholders."   the expedition3 study outcome is expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), or approximately $0.09 per share (after-tax). the company will provide updated 2016 financial guidance and announce its 2017 financial guidance on december 15, 2016 and will also conduct a conference call with the investment community and media at 9:00 a.m. et on that date, instead of on the originally-scheduled date of january 4, 2017.   about solanezumab   solanezumab is lilly's phase3 monoclonal antibody being studied as a potential therapy for people with mild cognitive impairment due to alzheimer's disease (expedition-pro), preclinical alzheimer's disease (anti-amyloid treatment in asymptomatic alzheimer's "a4"), and dominantly inherited alzheimer's disease ("dian").   about expedition3   expedition3 is a multinational, phase3 trial of solanezumab in more than 2,100 patients diagnosed with mild dementia due to alzheimer's disease. the study includes an 18-month placebo-controlled period followed by an open label extension. enrollment was completed in 2015 and the last patient visit for the placebo-controlled period occurred in october 2016. expedition3 is the first phase3 trial to evaluate only people with mild dementia due to alzheimer's disease.   about alzheimer's disease   alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that is believed to start with changes in the brain that may begin 20 years or more before symptoms appear.(1) those changes cause a progressive decline in memory and other aspects of cognition that eventually lead to dementia.   dementia due to alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.(1) there are currently an estimated 47 million people living with dementia worldwide.(2) the number of people affected by dementia is expected to be nearly 75 million in 2030 and 131 million in 2050.(2) estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as 5.4 million americans may have alzheimer's disease.(1)   about eli lilly and company   lilly is a global healthcare leader that unites caring with discovery to make life better for people around the world. we were founded more than a century ago by a man committed to creating high-quality medicines that meet real needs, and today we remain true to that mission in all our work. across the globe, lilly employees work to discover and bring life-changing medicines to those who need them, improve the understanding and management of disease, and give back to communities through philanthropy and volunteerism. to learn more about lilly, please visit us at www.lilly.com and newsroom.lilly.com/social-channels. p-lly   this press release contains certain forward-looking statements about solanezumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in clinical testing for treatment of alzheimer's disease, and the company's anticipated future results.  these statements reflect lilly's current beliefs. however, as with any pharmaceutical product, there are substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and commercialization. for further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties and additional information about the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward-looking statements, see lilly's most recent form 10-k and form 10-q filings with the united states securities and exchange commission. except as required by law, lilly undertakes no duty to update forward-looking statements to reflect events after the date of this release. 
nymox reports additional positive results from completed fexapotide bph phase3 studies showing significant early response and first-line efficacy   hasbrouck heights, n.j., nov. 29, 2016 (globe newswire) -- nymox pharmaceutical corporation (nasdaq:nymx) is pleased to announce that new phase3 prospective randomized clinical trial results have confirmed that patients who received fexapotide as their initial treatment for bph (prostate enlargement) had superior efficacy results as early as 10 days compared to control patients who received placebo or who had prior history of other bph medical treatments. these new phase3 results indicate that fexapotide in these trials was highly efficacious for first-line treatment of bph.   these findings are from analysis of the company's extensive us phase3 trials nx02-0017, nx02-0018, nx02-0020 and nx02-0022 including long-term follow-ups that were undertaken from 2009 to 2016. these important results come on top of many other positive results including successfully reaching long-term primary efficacy endpoints, that have previously been reported. the present prospective randomized trial results are new findings. 390 treatment naive patients with no past treatments for bph had improvements greater than previously treated bph patients as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.02) and at one month (p<.04), 3 months (p<.001), six months (p<.001), one year (p<.01) and at long-term (3.5 years) follow-up (p<.003). the levels of mean change from baseline pre-treatment ranged from 6.49 to 8.88 points improvement in the aua bph symptom score. these previously untreated patients who received a single injection of fexapotide 2.5 mg also had statistically significant superior improvements compared to patients who received placebo treatments, as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.001) and at several time points also including the long-term (3.5 years) follow-up extension (p<.001).   dr. paul averback, ceo of nymox said, "it is important to have now demonstrated for nymox's fexapotide, both 1. that it leads to an early onset of clinically noticeable improvement; and 2. that it works well long-term as a first-line therapeutic for men who have not tried other treatments before. there is a major unmet need for a convenient, safe and efficacious treatment for countless men worldwide with bph who are unhappy with their symptoms and who may be unhappy with their available choices."   traditional bph treatments have very undesirable side effects, particularly causing frequent problems with ejaculation and overall sexual function, as well as many other limiting side effects. pills for bph usually need to be taken permanently to remain effective and surgical treatments for bph often produce permanent distortions of ejaculation as well as other risks. middle aged and elderly male patients often need a safer and more effective way to manage these extremely common life problems.   nymox's lead drug fexapotide has been in development for over a decade and has been tested by expert clinical trial investigative teams in over 70 distinguished clinical trial centers throughout the us, and has been found after 7 years of prospective placebo controlled double blind studies of treatment of 995 us men with prostate enlargement to not only show clinically meaningful and durable relief of bph symptoms, but also to show a major reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer, compared to placebo and compared to the known and expected normal incidence of the disease. the same clinical program conducted at the same highly regarded treatment centers under rigorous trial scrutiny and performed strictly at arms-length by top teams of clinical investigators across the country, has also shown in a long-term blinded placebo crossover group study an 82-95% reduction in the number of these patients who required surgery after they received crossover fexapotide in the trial, as compared to patients who did not receive fexapotide but instead received crossover conventional approved bph treatments (p<.0001). the aim of the crossover study was to determine the clinical benefit fexapotide can provide to men who initially were double blind randomized to and received placebo, remained blinded as to their placebo treatment, and who subsequently required additional medical and/or surgical treatment. in that study long-term outcomes were determined in 391 patients who were given double blind placebo injections, followed by crossover to other treatments at the patients' discretion. the numbers of blinded placebo patients who subsequently received surgical treatment during the next 2-3 years for their bph symptoms were then prospectively analyzed.   for the earlier fexapotide phase3 long-term cancer incidence analysis, the men in the study received fexapotide or placebo for the treatment of their prostate enlargement (bph) symptoms. all men were thoroughly evaluated at expert urological testing investigational centers to exclude any prostate cancer prior to qualifying for enrollment in the studies. the participants were followed for up to 7 years (median of 5 years) after treatment. the study analyzed all cases of prostate cancer that were subsequently diagnosed. the expected rate of new prostate cancer in the us general male population in this age group is in the 5-20% range after 7 years. in the bph population in published large trials of drugs for the prevention of prostate cancer, the incidence of new prostate cancer cases after 4-7 years has been reported in major studies to be 20-25%. the data analysis from the nymox fexapotide study showed a statistically significant and very low incidence of 1.3% for prostate cancer in this comparable fexapotide treated bph population. by comparison, for example in a population of patients with erectile dysfunction treated with pde5 inhibitor drugs after 4 years the rate of subsequent prostate cancer was 19.5% (and 22.7% in controls) as recently reported in a large us study published in the journal of urology (volume 196; 3, 2016). the quoted study was in a population of middle aged and elderly men without prostate cancer, similar to the nymox study population.   nymox recently announced (october 11, 2016) positive long-term results in 344 patients who were given a single repeat fexapotide treatment after initial blinded treatment with fexapotide or placebo. patients were followed for 2 to 6.5 years (mean 4.2 years) after initial treatment and showed long-term statistically significant symptomatic improvement (mean improvement of 6.5 points in the aua bph symptom score) compared to phase3 patients who received placebo alone (p<.001). repeat injection was found to be safe with no significant drug related toxicities or side effects found in the study.   nymox has completed the execution of seven phase3 us bph clinical protocols, including 2 prospective randomized multicenter single injection double blind clinical trials; 2 us repeat injection clinical trials; and 3 us blinded long-term clinical trial extension studies. in addition, a number of phase3 safety and clinical pharmacology studies and analyses have been completed.   for more information please contact info@nymox.com or 800-936-9669.   forward looking statements   to the extent that statements contained in this press release are not descriptions of historical facts regarding nymox, they are forward-looking statements reflecting the current beliefs and expectations of management made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995, including statements regarding the need for new options to treat bph and prostate cancer, the potential of fexapotide to treat bph and prostate cancer and the estimated timing of further developments for fexapotide. such forward-looking statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our clinical development program, future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. such risks and uncertainties include, among others, the uncertainties inherent in the clinical drug development process, including the regulatory approval process, the timing of nymox's regulatory filings, nymox's substantial dependence on fexapotide, nymox's commercialization plans and efforts and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of fexapotide. nymox undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements. for a further description of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those expressed in these forward-looking statements, as well as risks relating to the business of nymox in general, see nymox's current and future reports filed with the us securities and exchange commission, including its annual report on form 20-f for the year ended december 31, 2015, and its quarterly reports.
vbl therapeutics announces overall survival data for vb-111 monotherapy in phase2 study for recurrent thyroid cancer    -- the study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating disease stabilization       and safety, along with a dose-response      -- newly released data show evidence of an overall survival benefit for       patients treated with therapeutic dose of vb-111    tel aviv, israel, nov. 29, 2016 (globe newswire) --  vbl therapeutics (nasdaq:vblt), today announced topline results from its exploratory phase2 study of vb-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in patients with advanced, differentiated thyroid cancer. as previously announced, this trial met its primary endpoint, which was defined as 25% progression-free survival at 6 months (pfs-6), in heavily-pretreated patients with late-stage disease. a dose-dependent response was seen, with 35% of patients reaching pfs-6 in the therapeutic dose cohort, versus 25% in a low-dose cohort. given this positive clinical response, the company continued to follow patients for overall survival (os) data, which was not a primary endpoint. although the trial included a small number of patients and was not powered to show os differences, the new data show a dose-response and evidence of an overall survival benefit in the cohort of patients treated with multiple therapeutic doses of vb-111, compared to patients who received a single low dose of vb-111 (mos 761 days versus 469 days; p=0.096).  only one patient remained alive in the low-dose cohort, compared to a tail of about 50% in the high dose group.   a photo accompanying this release is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/attachmentng/37de2b1f-1875-448f-a865-025fc63f92e7     "the appearance of dose-dependent superior overall survival provides encouragement, especially given that this trial enrolled patients with late-stage disease whose tumors were resistant to multiple lines of previous therapies," said keith c. bible, md, phd, professor of oncology, division of medical oncology, department of oncology, and endocrine malignancies disease oriented group, mayo clinic cancer center, and primary investigator for this trial.   "this is the third indication in which we have seen profound clinical responses and evidence of an overall survival benefit with vb-111," said dror harats, md, chief executive officer of vbl therapeutics. "following our phase2 os data in recurrent gbm and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, this trial, which evaluated vb-111 as monotherapy, reinforces the potential of vb-111 and its unique mechanism of action, for multiple solid tumor indications. we are continuing to focus on completion of our clinical program, and potentially commercialization, of vb-111 for rgbm, and to advance our ovarian cancer clinical program.  based on the current data, we may expand our program to additional indications, such as thyroid cancer, either independently in the future, or earlier in collaboration with a strategic partner," added prof. harats.   the open-label dose-escalating study enrolled patients with advanced, recently-progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer that is unresponsive to radioactive iodine, in two cohorts. the majority of patients had tumors which had failed on several therapeutic lines, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, prior to enrollment. in the first cohort twelve patients received a single intravenous infusion of vb-111 at a low dose of 3x10(12) viral particles (vps). the second cohort included seventeen patients, who received vb-111 at a therapeutic dose of 10(13) vps every two months until disease progression. the company previously reported that 35% of patients in the therapeutic dose cohort (n=17) met the primary endpoint of 6-month progression-free survival using response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (recist), compared to 25% of patients in the low dose cohort. pfs at 12 months was 25% in the vb-111 high dose cohort, versus 0% in the low dose cohort.  continued follow-up now indicates further survival benefit for the multiple-dose therapeutic cohort, with median os of 761 versus 469 in the low-dose cohort (p=0.096).  vb-111 was well-tolerated in this study, with no signs of clinically significant safety issues.   about thyroid cancer   thyroid cancer occurs in the thyroid gland, a hormone-producing organ at the base of the neck that regulates heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature and weight. according to the national cancer institute, there are an estimated 535,000 people currently living with thyroid cancer in the united states, with an estimated 60,000 new cases each year and an estimated 1,850 annual deaths as a result of the disease. the type of treatment depends on the cancer cell type, tumor size and severity of the disease. first-line treatment is surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and is recommended for most patients. treatment with radioactive iodine after surgery to destroy any remaining thyroid tissue may be recommended for more advanced disease. if radioactive iodine is ineffective, other treatments are prescribed, such tyrosine kinase inhibitors and systemic chemotherapy. however, if such treatments are unsuccessful, the therapeutic options for patients are currently very limited.   about vbl   vascular biogenics ltd., operating as vbl therapeutics, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer. the company's lead oncology product candidate, ofranergene obadenovec (vb-111), is a first-in-class, targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent that is positioned to treat a wide range of solid tumors. it is conveniently administered as an iv infusion once every two months. it has been observed to be well-tolerated in >200 cancer patients and we have observed its efficacy signals in an "all comers" phase1 trial as well as in three tumor-specific phase2 studies. ofranergene obadenovec is currently being studied in a phase3 pivotal trial for recurrent glioblastoma, conducted under an fda special protocol assessment (spa).   about ofranergene obadenovec (vb-111)   ofranergene obadenovec is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism to target solid tumors. based on a non-integrating, non-replicating, adeno 5 vector, ofranergene obadenovec utilizes vbl's proprietary vascular targeting system (vts(tm)) to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. unlike anti-vegf or tkis, ofranergene obadenovec does not aim to block a specific pro-angiogenic pathway; instead, it uses an angiogenesis-specific sensor (vbl's ppe-1-3x proprietary promoter) to specifically induce cell death in angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu. this mechanism retains activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows efficacy even after failure of prior treatment with other anti-angiogenics. moreover, ofranergene obadenovec induces specific anti-tumor immune response, which is accompanied by recruitment of cd8 t-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells.   ofranergene obadenovec completed a phase2 study in rgbm, which showed a statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec through progression, compared to either patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec followed by bevacizumab alone, or to historical bevacizumab data. in a phase2 trial for recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, ofranergene obadenovec demonstrated a statistically significant increase in overall survival and 60% durable response rate (as measured by reduction in ca-125), approximately 2x the historical response with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer. in a phase2 study in recurrent, iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid cancer, ofranergene obadenovec met the primary endpoint and provided evidence of disease stabilization and a positive safety profile. ofranergene obadenovec has received fast track designation for recurrent glioblastoma in the us and orphan drug status for glioblastoma in both the us and eu.   forward looking statements   this press release contains forward-looking statements. all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements, which are often indicated by terms such as "anticipate," "believe," "could," "estimate," "expect," "goal," "intend," "look forward to," "may, " "plan," "potential," "predict," "project," "should," "will," "would" and similar expressions. these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the clinical development of ofranergene obadenovec (vb-111) and its therapeutic potential and clinical results. these forward-looking statements are not promises or guarantees and involve substantial risks and uncertainties. among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described or projected herein include uncertainties associated generally with research and development, clinical trials and related regulatory reviews and approvals, and the risk that historical clinical trial results may not be predictive of future trial results. in particular, results from our pivotal phase3 clinical trial of ofranergene obadenovec (vb-111) in rgbm may not support approval of ofranergene obadenovec for marketing in the united states, notwithstanding the positive results seen in prior clinical experience. a further list and description of these risks, uncertainties and other risks can be found in the company's regulatory filings with the us securities and exchange commission, including in our annual report on form 20-f for the year ended december 31, 2015. existing and prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. vbl therapeutics undertakes no obligation to update or revise the information contained in this press release, whether as a result of new information, future events or circumstances or otherwise.

(nasdaq: cerc), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, today announced topline clinical results from its major depressive disorder (mdd) phase2 clinical trial (clin301-203) of aunctive treatment of cerc-301, an oral, nr2b specific, nmda receptor antagonist. overall, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy on the primary endpoint for mean improvement in bech-6, a subset of the hamilton depression scale (hdrs-17), averaged over days 2 and 4 post dose. however, the study showed signals for the cerc-301 20 mg dose group at day 2, at pre-specified secondary endpoints, indicating a potentially clinically-meaningful effect, though not statistically significant, on the bech-6 and hdrs-17.  the trial was a 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (spcd) study of intermittent doses of aunctive cerc-301 (12 mg or 20 mg) or placebo in the treatment of subjects with mdd who have not adequately responded to antidepressant therapy, either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) or a serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (snri).  the study randomized 115 subjects. the study was conducted in two sequential one week periods. placebo non-responders in period 1 were re-randomized to either study drug or placebo in period 2. subjects received treatment at the beginning of each period. the results of periods 1 and 2 were averaged. the study included a one-week follow-up.  in this spcd designed study, the mean improvement from baseline on the bech-6 scale averaged over days 2 and 4 post treatment for period 1 was 3.82 for placebo, 2.50 for the 12 mg dose and 4.11 for the 20 mg dose, and for period 2 was 2.86 for placebo, 1.64 for the 12mg dose and 3.38 for the 20 mg dose. the weighted average for the difference in placebo and drug improvement (placebo minus drug) was +1.45 and -0.04 for 12 mg and 20 mg cerc-301, respectively.  in a pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the bech-6 at day 2 for period 1 was 3.59 for placebo, 4.71 for 20 mg; and for period 2, 2.30 for placebo and 3.52 for 20 mg. in another pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the hdrs-17 at day 2 for period 1 was 6.24 for placebo and 9.71 for 20 mg; and for period 2, 3.60 for placebo and 5.38 for 20 mg.  significant improvement was not observed on the other secondary endpoints evaluated to date.  consistent with previous trials, cerc-301 was generally well-tolerated with no saes reported and no discontinuations due to aes. the most commonly reported adverse events in the study were increased blood pressure, dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia.  "while the trial failed to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, we note that these results suggest a potentially clinically meaningful treatment effect in the 20 mg dose at day 2," added ronald marcus, m.d., chief medical officer and head of regulatory affairs at cerecor.  "based on this well conducted and controlled clinical trial, we continue to believe that aunctive cerc-301 may have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms very rapidly with the added patient convenience of oral dosing," said dr. uli hacksell, president and chief executive officer of cerecor. "we intend to more fully assess the results from this trial as we continue to receive the remaining data sets over the coming weeks and will announce planned next steps for cerc-301 at a later time."  "from a clinician's perspective, these data warrant additional clinical testing to fully explore the potential for this compound to treat mdd," said dr. maurizio fava, director, division of clinical research of the massachusetts general hospital research institute & executive vice chair, department of psychiatry. "i would note that a minimum of 2 points of improvement on the hdrs-17 scale compared to placebo is considered by many, and noted in mdd studies, to be clinically meaningful."  cerecor intends to present additional data from this trial at scientific meetings in 2017.  conference call cerecor's management team will host a conference call and webcast today, november 29, 2016 at 5:00 p.m. et to discuss these topline results. presentation slides will be available via the webcast link. a question and answer session will follow management's remarks. to participate on the live call, please dial 877-407-2985 (domestic) or +1-201-378-4915 (international), approximately 5 to 10 minutes ahead of the start of the call.  a live audio webcast of the call will be available via the "investor relations" page of the cerecor website, www.cerecor.com. please log on through cerecor's website approximately 10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time. a replay of the webcast will be archived on cerecor's website for 90 days following the call.  about cerc-301 cerc-301 is an oral, nr2b selective, nmda receptor antagonist being developed as an aunctive treatment of mdd. cerc-301 may have the potential to be a first-in-class medication that may significantly reduce depressive symptoms in a matter of days. based on the signal of potential clinical meaningfulness shown in phase2 testing, we are currently assessing future development.  about cerecor cerecor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. in addition to cerc-301, cerecor is currently pursuing the development of cerc-501, which is also a clinical phase2-stage product candidate, as well as two earlier stage programs.  cerc-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist that is currently in a phase2 clinical trial for smoking cessation that is expected to provide topline data in december 2016. in addition to cerecor's phase2 trial, three externally-funded clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use of cerc-501 in treating depressive symptoms, stress related smoking relapse and cocaine addiction. one study is being conducted under the auspices of the national institute of mental health, the second is a collaboration between cerecor and yale university with funding from the national institutes of health and the third is being conducted at rockefeller university hospital with funding from a private foundation. cerecor intends to begin phase2 testing of cerc-501 for the treatment of aunctive mdd.  cerc-611 is a potent and selective transmembrane ampa receptor regulatory proteins ("tarp")-γ8-dependent α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ("ampa") receptor antagonist, which we plan to develop as an aunctive therapy for the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondarily generalized seizures in patients with epilepsy. we expect to file an investigational new drug application with the fda and thereafter commence phase1 development in 2017.  cerecor's brain penetrant catechol-o-methyltransferase inhibitors, including cerc-406, are in preclinical development and may have potential procognitive activity.
november 29, 2016 21:03:00 utc - conference call and webcast today at 4:30 p.m. est  arrowhead pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: arwr) today announced a strategic redeployment of resources to support the development of rnai therapeutics that utilize the company’s new proprietary subcutaneous (subq) and extra-hepatic delivery systems. arrowhead will discontinue development of clinical stage drug candidates arc-520, arc-521, and arc-aat, which utilize the dpciv™, or ex1, delivery vehicle. the company is hosting a conference call at 4:30 p.m. est to discuss this decision.  arrowhead remains committed to finding therapeutic options for patients with chronic hepatitis b (hbv) infection and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (aatd). the company intends to advance to the clinic two previously unannounced hbv and aatd programs using our subq platform. arrowhead has learned a great deal during prior hbv and aat studies that will help drive the subq programs efficiently.  existing preclinical subq and extra-hepatic programs such as arc-lpa and arc-amg1, which are partnered with amgen, arc-f12, arc-hif2, and other unannounced programs are not affected by this decision.  because of the discontinuation of its existing clinical programs, the company is reducing its workforce by approximately 30%, while maintaining full resourcing necessary to support current and potential future partner-based programs and arrowhead’s burgeoning pipeline. this more streamlined structure should enable the company to continue to develop its programs rapidly, and is intended to extend its cash runway into 2019.  the decision to discontinue development of ex1-containing programs was based primarily on two factors. first, during ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies and outside experts, it became apparent that there would be substantial delays in all clinical programs that utilize ex1, while the company further explored the cause of deaths in a non-clinical toxicology study in non-human primates. second, arrowhead has made substantial advances in rna chemistry and targeting resulting in large potency gains for subq administered and extra-hepatic rnai-based development programs. in preclinical studies with the subq platform, the company has obtained depth and duration of target gene knockdown approaching that of intravenously administered ex1-containing candidates, at lower doses and with good safety margins.  the company believes it is prudent to focus its development resources entirely on its subq and extra-hepatic pipeline, which includes programs in hbv, aat, factor 12, hif-2alpha, and other unannounced programs. in addition to its own pipeline, arrowhead is also focused on providing full resources to support its partnership with amgen and potential future partnerships for its subq and extra-hepatic delivery systems.  the tolerability of arc-520, arc-521, and arc-aat in human clinical trials appeared to be favorable, and in the company’s view, supported advancing the programs. ex1-containing candidates have been administered over 800 times in more than 300 human study subjects and patients and have been generally well tolerated, with a small minority (6%) of infusions being associated with infusion reactions. in addition, across the arc-520, arc-521, and arc-aat clinical programs, laboratory values have not been deemed indicative of drug induced organ toxicity.  in addition, each candidate was highly active against its respective target. for example, data presented earlier this month at the liver meeting® show that arc-aat achieved 90% knockdown of serum aat, which is believed to be near full suppression of liver production of the protein, in a phase1 clinical study. for arc-520, it was previously reported that reductions in surface antigen (hbsag) of almost 99%, or 2 logs, were achieved after a single dose. in subsequent multiple dose studies, for which data have not yet been reported, reductions of almost 3 logs were observed, with several patients being tracked that appear poised to possibly seroclear hbsag, representing potential function cures.  however, due to likely regulatory considerations, as of this announcement all patient recruitment for arc-520, arc-521, and arc-aat has been halted and dosing discontinued. the company will work together with investigators and clinical sites to ensure a smooth transition of study closure and patient medical care.  conference call and webcast details

broad portfolio of rna chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, arrowhead therapies trigger the rna interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep, and durable knockdown of target genes. rna interference, or rnai, is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. arrowhead’s rnai-based therapeutics leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing.  for more information, please visit www.arrowheadpharma.com, or follow us on twitter @arrowheadpharma. to be added to the company's

heat biologics presents topline hs-410 phase2 bladder cancer results at the society of urological oncology annual meeting   durham, n.c., nov. 30, 2016 (globe newswire) -- heat biologics, inc. (nasdaq:htbx), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies that are designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer, announced that it presented topline data from its 94-patient phase ii trial evaluating hs-410 (vesigenurtacel-l) in combination with standard of care, bacillus calmette-gu&#233;rin (bcg), or as a monotherapy, for the treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, at the society of urologic oncology annual meeting in san antonio, tx.   in the poster, "topline results from vesigenurtacel-l (hs-410) in combination with bcg from a randomized, blinded phase2 trial in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (nmibc)," researchers reported that there were encouraging signs of anti-tumor activity as hs-410 generated a robust antigen-specific immune response to multiple tumor-associated peptides in treated patients, while there were no immune responses of this type in the placebo.  however, these responses did not translate into clinical outcomes, and there was no statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint (proportion of recurrence-free survival at one year) between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. to better assess the durability of the positive immunological responses, and in keeping with clinical trial guidance recently issued by international bladder cancer group ("ibcg")(1) recommending a 2-year study duration for nmibc trials, heat will continue to monitor all patients enrolled in the study for an additional 12 months. at that time, heat will make a final determination whether to progress its bladder cancer program into a phase3 trial.   "the ability of hs-410 to prime t-cells suggests a strong signal that the vaccine is having an impact, as well as an opportunity to improve responses, in this challenging disease," said study principal investigator, gary steinberg, m.d., the bruce and beth white family professor of surgery and director of urologic oncology at the university of chicago. "historically, nmibc has been very difficult to treat, with bcg being the only approved therapy in the past 40 years. we were surprised to see that all arms of this trial performed much better than historical control, which is a testament to improvements in standard of care, and validates our choice to run a controlled clinical trial. we look forward to continuing to monitor patients in this trial, per ibcg recommendations. and would like to thank the many patients and their families for the commitment to this trial and advancement of the treatment of bladder cancer."   "we were pleased to see a robust antigen-specific immune response, reinforcing our earlier clinical data," jeff wolf, ceo of heat biologics, commented. "even though we did not achieve our desired clinical outcomes, we are encouraged by the results and believe this, and other combination therapies, have the potential to improve long-term outcomes. in particular, heat's compact technology, combining a therapeutic vaccine with an immune co-stimulator in a single product, was designed to substantially improve immune response durability. we are actively pursuing new programs to complement our existing platforms, which we expect to announce in early 2017. moreover, we look forward to examining the additional topline data that will be reported next week for our combination trial of hs-110 in with bristol-myers squibb's opdivo(r) (nivolumab) in lung cancer."   "hs-410 stimulated antigen-specific immune responses to multiple tumor-associated peptides," commented taylor schreiber, m.d., ph.d., chief scientific officer. "the kinetics of these responses indicate efficient priming of cd8+ t cells, consistent with results seen in other heat biologics clinical trials. remaining analyses are in progress to inform future development of other agents and/or combinations aimed at improving immune response durability. further understanding of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will advise future development steps."   "we conducted a cost-efficient trial and will continue to gather important data with minimal ongoing costs," mr. wolf added. "we have maintained a solid balance sheet and intend to continue to be very prudent in managing our expenses as we generate additional clinical data and progress our programs and platforms."   additionally, heat will be presenting topline data on its non-small cell lung cancer study of hs-110 in combination with bristol-myers squibb's opdivo(r) (nivolumab) at the international association for the study of lung cancer annual meeting in vienna, austria, on december 6(th) .  the presentation, "viagenpumatucel-l bolsters response to nivolumab therapy in advanced lung adenocarcinoma: preliminary data from the durga trial" will occur on december 6, 2016, 8:56 am est (14:56 cet). following this data release, heat plans to hold an investor call on december 8(th) to discuss its overall clinical strategy moving forward.   (1) definitions, end points, and clinical trial designs for non--muscle-invasive bladder cancer: recommendations from the international bladder cancer group, journal of clinical oncology, 34(16):1935-44, june, 2016.   about heat biologics, inc.   heat biologics, inc. (nasdaq:htbx) is an immuno-oncology company developing novel therapies that are designed to activate a patient's immune system against cancer utilizing an engineered form of gp96, a protein that activates the immune system when cells die. heat's highly specific t cell-stimulating therapeutic vaccine platform technologies, impact and compact, form the basis of its product candidates. these platforms, in combination with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are designed to address three distinct, but synergistic mechanisms of action: robust activation of cd8+ "killer" t cells (one of the human immune system's most potent weapons against cancer); reversal of tumor-induced immune suppression; and t cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune response.  currently, heat is conducting a phase2 trial with hs-410 (vesigenurtacel-l) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (nmibc) and a phase1b trial with hs-110 (viagenpumatucel-l) in combination with an anti-pd-1 checkpoint inhibitor to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).   heat's wholly-owned subsidiary, zolovax, inc., is developing therapeutic and preventative vaccines to treat infectious diseases based on heat's gp96 vaccine technology, with a current focus on the development of a zika vaccine, in conjunction with the university of miami. the zolovax patent portfolio also includes gp96 vaccines targeting zika and west nile virus, dengue and yellow fever among others.   for more information, please visit www.heatbio.com.   forward looking statements   this press release includes forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. in some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by terminology such as "may, " "should," "potential," "continue," "expects," "anticipates," "intends, " "plans," "believes," "estimates," and similar expressions. these statements are based upon current beliefs, expectations and assumptions and include statements regarding the potential of heat's impact and compact therapies and continuing to manage our future expenses prudently. these statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict, including the ability of heat's impact and compact therapies to perform as designed, the ability to enroll patients and complete the clinical trials on time, the other factors described in our annual report on form 10-k for the year ended december 31, 2015 and our other filings with the sec. the information in this release is provided only as of the date of this release, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this release based on new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

(nasdaq:ceru), a clinical-stage company developing nanoparticle-drug conjugates (ndcs), today announced topline results from the company's phase2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of its lead candidate, crlx101, in combination with avastin(r) (bevacizumab) in the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (rcc).   the trial was conducted at 43 sites in the us and south korea, and enrolled 115 patients with rcc who progressed through two or three prior lines of therapy. patients were randomized to receive crlx101 in combination with avastin or investigator's choice standard of care (soc) therapy. soc agents included axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus. the primary endpoint was progression free survival (pfs) in the clear cell population (n=102) assessed by independent radiological review. secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.   the study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median pfs and objective response rate for the crlx101 combination compared to soc. median pfs was 3.7 months for the crlx101 combination compared with a median pfs of 3.9 months for soc (hazard ratio: 1.25, p=0.822). the 95% confidence interval for pfs for the crlx101 combination was 2.0 months to 4.3 months and for soc was 2.2 months to 5.4 months. objective response rate by independent radiological review for patients who received the crlx101 combination was 5% (2/42) compared to 14% (6/43) for soc (p=0.836). the crlx101 and avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in previous studies. the full data set from the trial are expected to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.    "we are disappointed with this outcome and will undertake a thorough analysis of the data to understand why crlx101 plus avastin underperformed compared to the results we saw in an earlier investigator-sponsored trial," said christopher d. t. guiffre, president and chief executive officer of cerulean. "this outcome did not support our hypothesis that targeting hypoxia inducible factor (hif) in combination with vegf inhibitor in rcc, a hif-overexpressing tumor type, would be beneficial, so we will not pursue hif as a target going forward. we will continue to focus on the potent topoisomerase 1 inhibition of crlx101's payload, camptothecin, in topoisomerase 1-sensitive tumors. our combinations with weekly paclitaxel and lynparza(tm) (olaparib) are examples of ongoing trials that leverage crlx101's topoisomerase 1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapies and dna damage repair agents."   conference call details   cerulean will host a conference call today at 4:30 pm eastern daylight time to discuss the results and provide an update on the crlx101 development program. the call can be accessed by dialing (844) 831-3031 or (443) 637-1284 prior to the start of the call and referencing conference id: 67807137. the conference call will also be webcast live over the internet and can be accessed on the "investors" section of the cerulean website, www.ceruleanrx.com. the webcast will be available on cerulean's website for two weeks.   about crlx101   crlx101 is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (ndc) designed to concentrate in tumors and slowly release its anti-cancer payload, camptothecin, inside tumor cells. crlx101 inhibits topoisomerase 1 (topo 1), which is involved in cellular replication. crlx101 has shown activity in multiple tumor types, both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments. crlx101 is in phase2 clinical development and has been dosed in more than 400 patients. the us fda has granted crlx101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of ovarian cancer, fast track designation in combination with paclitaxel for platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer, and fast track designation in combination with avastin(r) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.   about cerulean pharma   the cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with cancer. we apply our dynamic tumor targeting(tm) platform to create a portfolio of ndcs designed to selectively attack tumor cells, reduce toxicity by sparing the body's normal cells, and enable therapeutic combinations. our first platform-generated ndc clinical candidate, crlx101, is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments, all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy. our second platform-generated ndc clinical candidate, crlx301, is in phase2a clinical development. for more information, please visit www.ceruleanrx.com.   about cerulean's dynamic tumor targeting(tm) platform   cerulean's dynamic tumor targeting platform creates ndcs that are designed to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments. we believe our ndcs concentrate their anti-cancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal tissue because they are small enough to pass through the "leaky" vasculature present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy blood vessels. once inside tumors, our ndcs enter tumor cells where they slowly release anti-cancer payloads from within the tumor cells. 
ac immune partner genentech presents important data on alzheimer's therapy crenezumab    -- crenezumab higher dose in cread phase3 alzheimer's trial supported by       exposure-response model     -- phase1b dose-escalation study results support 60mg/kg dose in cread       phase3   lausanne, switzerland, december 9, 2016 - ac immune sa (nasdaq: aciu), a swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that its partner genentech, member of roche group, has presented important data to support the unique binding and increased dosing of its alzheimer's therapy on crenezumab, an anti-abeta antibody. these data were presented at the 9(th) clinical trials on alzheimer's disease conference (ctad) in san diego, usa: they were from a phase1b safety study and an exposure-response model to evaluate the best dose of crenezumab for the treatment of people with alzheimer's disease. the model predicts, relative to the phase2 trials, an improved outcome of the cread phase3 clinical trial in patients with prodromal-to-mild alzheimer by using the higher dose of 60mg/kg of crenezumab.   prof. andrea pfeifer, ceo of ac immune, commented: "we are impressed by the drug-disease model, as well as the safety data of the phase1b study which further support the higher dose of crenezumab in the phase iii trial targeting prodromal-to-mild alzheimer patients."   about the crenezumab drug-disease progression model   genentech has developed a comprehensive drug-disease progression model to simulate the phase3 clinical trial and estimate the likelihood of achieving relative reduction in disease progression in patients treated with different doses of crenezumab, in different patient populations. the drug-disease model adequately described the historical longitudinal decline in adas-cog 12([1]) and cdr-sb([2]) in mild to moderate ad patients of crenezumab in phase2 studies (abby/blaze).   the clinical trial simulations using the drug-disease model predict a meaningful response of crenezumab in patients with mild ad at a dose of 60mg/kg iv every 4 weeks, as measured by cdr-sb and adas-cog 12. this dose of 60mg/kg iv was selected by genentech for the phase3 cread trial, which started recruitment of patients in q1 2016.   about the phase1b study results   genentech presented the results of the first two cohorts of the phase1b crenezumab dose escalation study (nct02353598) in 52 patients with mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease. no dose-limiting toxicities were observed at 30, 45 and 60mg/kg doses of crenezumab. no events of amyloid related imaging abnormality-edema (aria-e) were observed in the phase1b study and only a few patients (6 of 52) showed asymptomatic amyloid related imaging abnormality-hemsiderin(aria-h) which did not result in treatment discontinuation. the pharmacokinetic profile of crenezumab is dose proportional up to the 60mg/kg dose and is consistent with historical data. the serum concentrations at this dose are four fold higher than in the 15mg/kg iv every four weeks dose used in the phase2 trials. these safety and pharmacokinetic data of the phase1b dose escalation study support the continued treatment of patients with crenezumab at a higher dose of 60mg/kg.    about crenezumab   crenezumab was discovered by ac immune using its supraantigen technology platform and out-licensed to genentech in 2006 as a potential therapy for alzheimer's disease.  crenezumab is a fully humanized igg4 monoclonal antibody that binds all forms of misfolded abeta proteins, but especially to abeta oligomers, to prevent and break up abeta aggregation and promote abeta disaggregation. the igg4 subclass has reduced the effector function, allowing microglia to clear abeta from the brain while minimizing an inflammatory response.   genentech is currently evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of crenezumab in a phase3 clinical trial, cread, in 750 participants with prodromal or mild alzheimer's disease, which started in q1 2016 and is expected to read out in 2020. in addition crenezumab was chosen by an international panel of experts, including the us national institutes of health, for use in a first-ever prevention trial in alzheimer's disease in a large extended family in colombia (api adad) in 2012.   about alzheimer's disease   it is becoming increasingly clear that alzheimer's disease develops because of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long period of time. two proteins - tau and beta-amyloid (abeta) - are recognized as major hallmarks of neurodegeneration: tangles and other abnormal forms of tau protein accumulate inside the brain cells and spread between cells, while plaques and oligomers formed by beta-amyloid occur outside the brain cells of people with ad.   ad is one of the biggest burdens of society with a dramatic and growing worldwide incidence rate of one new case every three seconds, or 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year. since the incidence and prevalence of ad increase with age, the number of patients will grow significantly as society ages. worldwide in 2015 there are 46.8 million people living with dementia and by 2050 it is expected that global patient numbers will triple to 131.5 million. it is estimated that the annual societal and economic cost of dementia has risen from us$ 604 billion in 2010 to us$ 818 billion in 2015. in the us, ad is now the 6th leading cause of death across all ages and is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older.   about ac immune   ac immune is a clinical stage swiss-based biopharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases with four product candidates in clinical trials. the company designs, discovers and develops therapeutic and diagnostic products intended to prevent and modify diseases caused by misfolding proteins. ac immune's two proprietary technology platforms create antibodies, small molecules and vaccines designed to address a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative indications, such as alzheimer's disease. the company's pipeline features seven therapeutic and three diagnostic product candidates. the most advanced of these is crenezumab, an anti-abeta antibody in phase3 clinical studies that is being advanced by the collaboration partner genentech, inc., a member of the roche group. other business partners include biogen, janssen pharmaceuticals, nestl&#233; institute of health sciences and piramal imaging. 
synergy pharmaceuticals inc. (nasdaq:sgyp) today announced positive topline results from the first of two pivotal phase3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide, an investigational once-daily orally-administered compound, in 1,135 adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c).  preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both plecanatide 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study’s primary endpoint and showed statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were overall responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (21.5% in 3 mg and 24.0% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 14.2% in placebo; p=0.009 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg). an overall responder, as defined by the fda, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (csbm) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks.  the most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 3.2% of patients in 3 mg and 3.7% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 1.3% of placebo-treated patients.  “we are very pleased with these results,” said gary s. jacob, ph.d., chairman and ceo of synergy pharmaceuticals inc. “these data reinforce our strong belief that plecanatide may represent an important new treatment option for the millions of patients currently suffering from ibs-c. we look forward to the results of our second phase3 ibs-c trial with plecanatide later this month.”  four patients in the trial (0.4%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (1.9% in 3 mg and 1.8% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (0.8% in 3 mg and 1.6% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).  additionally, plecanatide is under review by the food and drug administration (fda) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (cic) and the prescription drug user fee act (pdufa) target action date is january 29, 2017. pending approval in the cic indication, the company plans to file a new drug application supplement with clinical data (snda) for plecanatide in ibs-c in q1 2017.  the plecanatide phase3 ibs-c program  design  the plecanatide phase3 ibs-c program includes two randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide treatment (3 mg and 6 mg doses), taken as a tablet once-a-day in patients with ibs-c. both trials included a two-week pre-treatment baseline period, a 12-week treatment period, and a two-week post-treatment follow-up period. the phase3 ibs-c program was designed to support regulatory submission in the us  the first phase3 ibs-c trial was conducted in north america and assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).  primary endpoint  the primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are overall responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. an overall responder, as defined by the fda, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (csbm) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. the overall responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for us approval in ibs-c.  patient population  patients were selected using rome 3 criteria for ibs-c. patients with ibs-c are defined by rome iii criteria as having a history of constipation and abdominal pain for at least 6 months, including hard or lumpy stools for 25% or more of defecations, loose or watery stools for 25% or less of defecations, and abdominal pain or discomfort for 3 days or more per month for the last 3 months.  about irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (ibs-c)  irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a chronic, complex condition subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (ibs-c), diarrhea (ibs-d), or mixed (ibs-m). it is estimated that the prevalence of ibs-c in the us adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, though this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of ibs. ibs is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.  about plecanatide  plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human gi peptide which acts in a ph-sensitive manner targeting gc-c receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.
heat biologics presents topline hs-110/nivolumab combination lung cancer results   reports positive data on primary endpoint with positive safety data   overall survival compares favorably with single-agent nivolumab   management to host a call on thursday, december 8(th) , at 8:30 a.m. et   durham, n.c., dec. 06, 2016 (globe newswire) -- heat biologics, inc. (nasdaq:htbx), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer, reported topline response and survival results in the ongoing phase1b study evaluating hs-110, in combination with bristol-myers squibb's anti-pd-1 checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (opdivo(r)), for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc), at the international association for the study of lung cancer annual meeting in vienna, austria.   in an oral presentation, principal investigator, daniel morgensztern, md, associate professor of medicine and director of thoracic oncology, washington university school of medicine, reported that one-year results from the first eight trial patients showed that the hs-110/nivolumab combination was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with single agent nivolumab. there were no additional toxicities seen in hs-110/nivolumab combination compared to existing data on single agent nivolumab alone. hs-110 generated a robust antigen-specific immune response in several patients, consistent with the mechanism of action seen in other hs-110 trials.  additionally, the patients who responded best to the combination therapy (immune responders) had longer overall survival and better objective response rate (orr) than the non-immune responders, even though they had the same baseline immune function.   immune responders in the study saw a 50% orr, while non-immune responders saw a 0% orr. this is important, as checkpoint inhibitors have been shown, independently, to be much more effective in tumors with pre-existing, high tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (til). as such, there now exists an acute need to address the large proportion of non-responders with low-til tumors.   moreover, the immune responders had a better median overall survival (os) than non-immune responders. the one-year os is currently 50% for the responders, and 25% for the non-responders. finally, immune responders also saw a better median os at 12.7 months, than non-immune responders, who saw a median os of 7.1 months.  researchers concluded that immune response may correlate with clinical efficacy and that hs-110 may have synergistic activity with immune checkpoint inhibitors.   "we are encouraged by the data generated in the trial," said dr. morgensztern. "we were impressed by the ability of hs-110 to activate a cd8+ t cell immune response. the hs-110/nivolumab combination is worth continued exploration in the treatment of lung cancer, as the hs-110 mechanism of action is potentially synergistic with anti-pd-1 checkpoint inhibitors."   "we've continued to see elispot analysis correlate with clinical efficacy with hs-110 in nsclc, an encouraging trend also observed in other trials with hs-110," said taylor schreiber, md, phd, heat's chief scientific officer. "we are seeing trends between til status and til increases after treatment among these patients, which may speak to the ability of hs-110 to convert "cold" tumors to "hot" tumors to increase the effectiveness of pd-1 checkpoint therapy in lung cancer."   "these new data are further confirmation of the ability of our impact platform, which has been administered to over 200 patients in 4 clinical studies, to generate a robust antigen-specific immune response, an important component of immunotherapy," said jeff wolf, heat's ceo.  "the future of immuno-oncology lies in combining synergistic modalities to create more effective treatments. at heat, we are actively pursuing opportunities to combine our impact and compact platforms with checkpoint inhibitors, and other promising immunotherapies to improve patient outcomes."   heat plans to hold an investor call on december 8(th) at 8:30 a.m. et to discuss its overall clinical strategy moving forward. the call will be available on the company's website at www.heatbio.com, or by calling 866-320-0174 for us callers, or +1 785-424-1631 for international callers.  a webcast will also be archived on the company's website and a telephone replay of the call will be available approximately one hour following the call, through midnight december 15, 2016, and can be accessed by calling: 877-481-4010 (us callers) or +1 919-882-2331 (international callers) and entering conference id: 10169.   the oral presentation will be uploaded to heat's website at http://www.heatbio.com/our-science/publications in line with the conference's embargo policy.   about heat biologics, inc.   heat biologics, inc. (nasdaq:htbx) is an immuno-oncology company developing novel therapies that are designed to activate a patient's immune system against cancer utilizing an engineered form of gp96, a protein that activates the immune system when cells die. heat's highly specific t cell-stimulating therapeutic vaccine platform technologies, impact and compact, form the basis of its product candidates. these platforms, in combination with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are designed to address three distinct but synergistic mechanisms of action: robust activation of cd8+ "killer" t cells (one of the human immune system's most potent weapons against cancer); reversal of tumor-induced immune suppression; and t cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune response.  currently, heat is conducting a phase1b trial with hs-110 (viagenpumatucel-l) in combination with an anti-pd-1 checkpoint inhibitor to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (nsclc).   heat's wholly-owned subsidiary, zolovax, inc., is developing therapeutic and preventative vaccines to treat infectious diseases based on heat's gp96 vaccine technology, with a current focus on the development of a zika vaccine in conjunction with the university of miami. the zolovax patent portfolio also includes gp96 vaccines targeting west nile virus, dengue and yellow fever among others.   for more information, please visit www.heatbio.com. 
anavex life sciences announces 12-month data of anavex 2-73 in a phase2a study in mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease patients   data presentation at ctad 2016   new york, dec. 08, 2016 (globe newswire) -- anavex life sciences corp. ("anavex" or the "company") (nasdaq:avxl) today announced a positive 57-week update from its phase2a study in mild-to-moderate alzheimer's disease (ad) patients for anavex 2-73, which targets cellular homeostasis. the study met both primary and secondary endpoints.   at 57 weeks, alzheimer's patients taking a daily oral dose between 10mg and 50mg, anavex 2-73 was well tolerated. there were no clinically significant treatment-related adverse events and no serious adverse events.   published ad studies confirmed substantial declines of cognitive (mmse) and functional (adcs-adl) measures as well as cogstate and eeg/erp over 12 month in similar ad populations. pre-specified exploratory analyses of the current study included the cognitive (mmse) and the functional (adcs-adl) as well as cogstate, ham-d and eeg/erp changes from baseline.   specifically, in comparison to historical control from a pooled placebo arm cohort study conducted by the alzheimer disease cooperative study group in mild-to-moderate ad patients of comparable ages and mmse baselines, over 12 month the anavex 2-73 data shows a calculated treatment benefit of 1.8 points on the mmse scale (p<0.016) and a calculated treatment benefit of 4 points on the adcs-adl score (p<0.019). furthermore, the correlation was positive with all measured scores (mmse, adcs-adl, cogstate, ham-d and eeg/erp).   george perry, phd, dean and professor at the university of texas at san antonio and editor-in chief of the journal of alzheimer's disease, commented, "in addition to the very encouraging results, which point to the therapeutic potential of targeting cellular homeostasis in a complex cns disease like alzheimer's, this trial has been intelligently designed as a highly informative study, looking unprejudiced at all potential relationships and hence allowing to learn from all correlations of the now available pool of data, in order to execute subsequent trials with much more relevant information at hand."   despite non-optimized dosing of anavex 2-73 throughout the 12-month study, continued significant improvements from baseline of cognitive, functional and behavioral scores in a group of patients were observed, respectively. this data will be analyzed using refined mathematical modeling methods in conjunction with the detailed pharmacokinetic (pk) information.   "alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes problems with memory, thinking and behavior. currently available treatments cannot stop alzheimer's from progressing; they can only temporarily slow the worsening of dementia symptoms," said christopher u. missling, phd, president and chief executive officer of anavex. "we believe this data gives us a solid foundation from which to continue the next phase of rationally designed clinical trials. anavex is grateful for the dedication of the patients, their families and the clinical investigators who participated in this study."   the company is presenting findings from the study at the clinical trials on alzheimer's disease (ctad) meeting on saturday, december 10th at 8:45 a.m. pt in the oral communication session. the presentation will be available in the publications section of the anavex website.   the company will also conduct a conference call with the investment community in conjunction with the upcoming financial year-end 2016 report.   about the anavex 2-73 phase2a study   the multicenter phase2a clinical trial of anavex 2-73 consists of two parts and a total of 32 mild-to-moderate alzheimer's patients. part a is a simple randomized, open-label, two-period, cross-over between oral (30mg/50mg) and iv (3mg/5mg) administration, adaptive trial lasting up to 5 weeks for each patient. part b is an open-label extension for an additional 52 weeks. initially planned for 26 weeks, part b was extended to 52 weeks as a result of requests from patients and caregivers.   the primary endpoint of the phase2a trial is to establish safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (mtd) of anavex 2-73, which had shown potential in preclinical studies to prevent, halt and/or reverse the course of the disease. secondary endpoints include dose response, bioavailability, and exploratory cognitive as well as functional measures using mini mental state examination (mmse) and evaluation of alzheimer's disease co-operative study -- activities of daily living inventory (adcs-adl), as well as cogstate test battery and eeg/erp.   additional information regarding the ongoing phase2a clinical trial is available from the us national institutes of health (nih) clinical trials database at www.clinicaltrials.gov.   about ctad 2016   the international conference on clinical trials for alzheimer's disease (ctad) is an annual conference organized and planned by alzheimer's disease clinical researchers to share scientific information with each other. the 9th annual ctad 2016 will be held december 8-10 in san diego, ca. further information is available at http://www.ctad-alzheimer.com/.   about anavex life sciences corp.   anavex life sciences corp.

voyager therapeutics announces positive interim results from phase1b trial of vy-aadc01 for advanced parkinson's disease   vy-aadc01 dose-dependently improved measures of motor function and enhanced response to levodopa at six and twelve months; administration of vy-aadc01 was well-tolerated   program on track to report cohort 3 data mid-2017 and to begin placebo-controlled trial q4:17   conference call scheduled for today at 4:30 p.m. est   cambridge, mass., dec. 07, 2016 (globe newswire) -- voyager therapeutics, inc. (nasdaq:vygr), a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing life-changing treatments for severe diseases of the central nervous system (cns), today announced positive results from the ongoing phase1b trial of vy-aadc01 at six and twelve months of follow-up in patients with advanced parkinson's disease.  the interim data from cohorts 1 and 2 of this trial demonstrated that accurate mri-guided delivery of escalating doses of vy-aadc01 were well tolerated and resulted in increased coverage of the putamen, increased aadc enzyme activity, enhanced response to levodopa, and dose-related, clinically meaningful improvements in various measures of patients' motor function.  this was especially evident at the higher dose in cohort 2 with improved updrs off medication and on medication scores, and corresponding improvements in patient-reported diary hours, suggesting higher peak effects and a longer duration of action of levodopa.  these effects were maintained and in some patients improved at 12 months of follow-up.   "at 12 months in cohort 2, treatment with vy-aadc01 resulted in a 14-point, or 44%, improvement in updrs-iii off medication, a 9-point, or 55% improvement in updrs-iii on medication, and a 2.2 hour, or 48%, decrease in diary off-time from baseline," said bernard ravina, m.d., m.s., vice president of clinical development at voyager therapeutics. "very importantly, these improvements in motor function occurred with a substantial 34% reduction in daily doses of oral levodopa and related medications at six months in cohort 2 that was maintained at 12 months, a magnitude that we find compelling and consistent with the mechanism of action of vy-aadc01.  the dose-escalating portion of this trial continues and we plan to complete cohort 3 enrollment in early 2017, report 6-month data from this cohort as well as longer-term data from cohorts 1 and 2 in mid-2017, and present results from this trial at a medical conference in the first half of next year."   about the phase1b trial   in advanced parkinson's disease, the putamen is depleted of dopamine and of the enzyme aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (aadc) that is responsible for converting levodopa to dopamine.  vy-aadc01 is voyager's gene therapy vector that contains the gene that encodes the aadc enzyme. the phase1b, open-label trial includes up to 20 patients with advanced parkinson's disease and disabling motor fluctuations, treated with a single administration of vy-aadc01.  the primary objective of the trial is to assess the safety and surgical coverage of ascending doses of vy-aadc01 in the putamen, a region of the brain associated with motor function in parkinson's disease.  the secondary objectives of the trial include the assessment of aadc expression and activity in the putamen measured by positron emission tomography (pet) using [(18) f] fluorodopa (or (18) f-dopa).  in addition, changes in motor responses to levodopa are measured by a controlled intravenous infusion of levodopa and by measuring daily requirements for levodopa and related medications. other secondary objectives include assessment of motor function as measured by the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs) and a patient-completed (hauser) diary.   the updrs is a standard clinical rating scale for parkinson's disease. part iii of this scale measures motor function by physician examination. the updrs is conducted when patients are taking their parkinson's disease medications (referred to as "on" medication) and when patients are not taking their parkinson's disease medications (referred to as "off" medication).  in the patient-completed diary, patients record their motor response over the course of several days as on-time, or time when they have good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, off-time when they have poor mobility, and on-time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have uncontrolled movements.   biomarker and clinical results summary   today's interim results include data from all 10 patients treated in cohorts 1 and 2 at six months (five patients in each cohort), and where indicated, data from five patients in cohort 1 and three patients in cohort 2 who have reached 12 months of follow-up.  patients in cohorts 1 and 2 received a single administration of vy-aadc01 at a total dose of up to 7.5&#215;10(11) vector genomes (vg) and 1.5&#215;10(12) vg, respectively.  patients enrolled in cohorts 1 and 2 were on average 58 years of age with a parkinson's disease diagnosis for an average of 10 years.  patients were candidates for surgical intervention due to disabling motor complications despite treatment with optimal anti-parkinsonian medication.  at baseline, the average updrs iii off medication score was 37.2 and 35.8, and the average patient diary off-time was 4.9 and 4.2 hours, for cohort 1 and 2, respectively. patients' average amount of parkinson's disease medications at baseline was 1,468 mg per day for cohort 1 and 1,636 mg per day for cohort 2. the results below are reported as mean changes from baseline to six months, or 12 months where indicated.   putamen coverage and biomarker data    -- the use of real-time, intra-operative mri-guided delivery and increasing        infusion volumes resulted in 21% coverage of the volume of the putamen       with vy-aadc01 in cohort 1 and 34% coverage in cohort 2.     -- vy-aadc01 treatment resulted in a 13% increase in putaminal aadc enzyme       activity in cohort 1 and a 56% increase in putaminal aadc enzyme activity       in cohort 2 at six months relative to baseline as measured by 18f-dopa       pet scans.     -- patients reduced their daily oral dose of levodopa and related       medications by 14% in cohort 1 and 34% in cohort 2 at six months.  this       reduction in oral medication was generally maintained at twelve months.     -- vy-aadc01 treatment prolonged the duration and markedly increased the       motor symptom response to levodopa measured following a controlled       intravenous infusion of levodopa administered six months after surgery       when compared to baseline.   clinical data summary   treatment with vy-aadc01 resulted in the following:    -- 15.6-point and 17.8-point (42% and 50%) improvement (reduction) in       updrs-iii off medication at six months in cohort 1 and cohort 2,       respectively.  these improvements were 16.4-point and 14.3-point (44% and       44%) for cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, at 12 months.     -- 9.6-point (56%) improvement (reduction) in updrs-iii on medication in       cohort 2 at six months that was sustained at 12 months.  cohort 1       demonstrated a 1.6-point (21%) worsening (increase) at six months that       was sustained at 12 months.     -- 2.2 hours (20%) increase in diary on-time (with no dyskinesias or       non-troublesome dyskinesias) in cohort 2 at six months that further       increased to 4.1 hours (43%) at 12 months.  cohort 1 showed a slight       decrease in on-time at six months of 0.3 hours (-3%) and an increase of       1.6 hours (16%) at 12 months.     -- 1.1 hour (27%) decrease in diary off-time in cohort 2 at six months that        further decreased to 2.2 hours (48%) at 12 months.  decreases in diary       off-time in cohort 2 also occurred in conjunction with a reduction in       troublesome dyskinesias.  cohort 1 showed a decrease in diary off-time of       0.8 hours (16%) at six months and 1.4 hours (27%) at 12 months.   safety data from cohorts 1 and 2   the surgical procedure was successfully completed in all 10 patients and infusions of vy-aadc01 have been well-tolerated with no vector-related serious adverse events (saes).  nine of the 10 patients were discharged from the hospital within one to two days following surgery.  as previously reported, one patient experienced two saes; a pulmonary embolism or blood clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat.  the patient was treated with an anti-coagulant and symptoms associated with the saes have completely resolved. investigators determined that this was most likely related to immobility during the surgical procedure and subsequent formation of a blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis (dvt), in the lower extremity.  consequently, dvt prophylaxis was added to the surgical protocol and no subsequent events have been observed following implementation of these measures.   "our surgical experience with vy-aadc01 and the results to date show that mri-guided infusions are well tolerated and substantially improve our ability to tailor the infusions to fit the patients' anatomy and accurately deliver vector to the putamen," said paul larson, m.d., professor and vice chair of clinical neurological surgery, university of california san francisco, and investigator in the trial.  "the increased surgical coverage of the putamen is further validated by the pet data and is translating into motor function improvement in patients with advanced stages of the disease."    todd sherer, ph.d., chief executive officer, the michael j. fox foundation for parkinson's research added, "levodopa has been the gold-standard treatment for parkinson's for decades, but it has limitations.  enhancing a patient's response to this therapy represents an important development for those who suffer from the advanced stages of this disease, and we are glad to see the continued progress of this program."  the michael j. fox foundation funded part of the initial pioneering research for this program in dr. krystof bankiewicz's laboratory at the university of california san francisco. 
contravir's cyclophilin inhibitor crv431 potently inhibits essential pathway in hepatitis b   first small molecule drug to target critical function of hbx regulatory molecule   pr newswire   edison, n.j., dec. 8, 2016   edison, n.j., dec. 8, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- contravir pharmaceuticals, inc. (nasdaq: ctrv), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today provided new insights into the mechanism of action of its hepatitis b (hbv)-optimized cyclophilin inhibitor crv431, showing that it effectively blocks a critical interaction between hbv x protein (hbx) and host cyclophilin a, with nanomolar potency.  crv431 is believed to be the first antiviral drug with the potential to selectively block the hbx pathway, which is known to play several significant roles in hbv infection including protecting infected liver cells from immune destruction, and promoting the development of liver cancer.   hbx is a multifunctional viral protein known to be essential for hbv replication and for the maintenance and progression of chronic hbv disease. hbx is involved in the production and secretion of key viral proteins, such as hbsag and hbeag. hbx further disables host factors that restrict the production of hbv and other viral products, including covalently closed circular dna (cccdna) which is key to the persistence of chronic hbv infection. contravir's recent in vitro studies indicate that crv431 blocks the interaction between hbx and cyclophilin a, which is required for hbx to function fully.   importantly, hbx is required early in the viral life cycle and works "upstream" of other classes of anti-hbv drugs.  crv431 therefore could potentially interrupt several essential pathways enabling development of a curative combination with other hbv treatments.  crv431 has demonstrated synergistic activity in vitro with contravir's tenofovir prodrug cmx157, currently in phase2 clinical trials.   "identifying this exciting mechanism of action for crv431 places contravir at the very forefront of hbv research, with a compound that can effectively target the hbx pathway," said james sapirstein, ceo of contravir.  "further development of this novel compound, and ultimately layering it on top of cmx157 and potentially other hbv drugs, dovetails with our overall development strategy which is focused on finding a functional cure for hbv. the pathogenic effects of hbx are many, and we would therefore expect the anti-hbx activity of crv431 to be equally robust.  we will continue to work on characterizing the activity of crv431 and its impact on hbx and hbv within our company, and through our peers in north america and europe."   philippe gallay, ph.d., professor at the scripps research institute, who conducted the in vitro study, commented, "hbx and its involvement in the pathogenesis of hbv is widely supported by the scientific literature, and its importance as a high-value drug target was highlighted at the recent joint hbv conference hosted by the american association of the study of liver diseases (aasld) and the european association for the study of the liver (easl).  however, until now, we hadn't confirmed the ability of an antiviral drug to bind to a specific ligand of hbx -- cyclophilin a.  crv431 may therefore be unique as a small molecule drug that selectively targets the function of hbx and thus has the potential to repress, among other things, cccdna transcription, which has exciting implications about its potential to significantly inhibit hbv when used together with complementary antivirals.  we are proud to lead this cutting edge research by continuing to advance crv431."   about contravir pharmaceuticals   contravir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis b virus (hbv). the company is developing two novel anti-hbv compounds with complementary mechanisms of action: cmx157, a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir currently in phase2a, which has demonstrated the potential for low, once a day dosing compared to viread(r) and decreased systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects; and crv431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against hbv. contravir is also developing valnivudine (tm) (formerly fv-100), an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, in a phase3 clinical trial. in addition to direct antiviral activity, valnivudine(tm) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (phn) in a phase2 clinical study. for more information visit www.contravir.com. 
horizon pharma plc announces topline results from phase3 study of actimmune(r) (interferon gamma-1b) in friedreich's ataxia   conference call today at 8 a.m. et   dublin, ireland, dec. 08, 2016 (globe newswire) -- horizon pharma plc (nasdaq:hznp), a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients' lives by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs, today announced that the phase3 trial, steadfast (safety, tolerability and efficacy of actimmune dose escalation in friedreich's ataxia study), evaluating actimmune(r) (interferon gamma-1b) for the treatment of friedreich's ataxia (fa) did not meet its primary endpoint of a statistically significant change from baseline in the modified friedreich's ataxia rating scale (fars--mneuro) at 26 weeks versus treatment with placebo.  fars--mneuro is an exam-based rating scale that measures disease progression based on functional parameters such as speech, ability to swallow, upper and lower limb coordination, gait and posture.   in addition, the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance. no new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than those already noted in the actimmune prescribing information for approved indications.  the company, in conjunction with the independent data safety monitoring board, the principal investigator and the friedreich's ataxia research alliance (fara) collaborative clinical research network (ccrn) in fa, has determined that, based on the trial results, the fa development program will be discontinued, including the 26-week extension study and the long-term safety study.   patients participating in the ongoing extension studies should contact their study site coordinator for further information and next steps.   the company will continue to work with fara and the principal investigator to further analyze the data to help inform future research efforts as well as future data presentation or publication.   "a well-designed, rigorous study like steadfast would not have been possible without the extraordinary drive of the fa community, particularly the people who enrolled in the study, the clinical trial investigators and the friedreich's ataxia research alliance," said timothy p. walbert, chairman, president and chief executive officer, horizon pharma plc.  "while the results were not what we hoped for, this is the very reason why research and development is important -- to find answers that may help inform future research."   "fara's mission is to drive research to develop therapies that will treat and cure friedreich's ataxia and we remain passionately committed to that mission so that one day soon patients and caregivers impacted by this devastating disease will have effective treatment options," said ronald j. bartek, co-founder and founding president, fara.  "we want to extend our sincere appreciation to all of the patients, patient families and investigators who were a part of this study as well as horizon for collaborating with us so impressively on this important research."   the announcement today does not impact horizon pharma's full-year 2016 austed net sales or austed ebitda guidance, and the company believes it is well-positioned for growth in 2017 and beyond based on its existing portfolio of medicines.  horizon's management will host a live conference call and webcast at 8 a.m. et to discuss the results of the steadfast study.  conference call details are:   us telephone:  1-888-338-8373 (us)   international telephone:  973-872-3000   conference id number:  35706781   the live webcast and a replay may be accessed by visiting horizon's website at http://ir.horizon-pharma.com.  please connect to the company's website at least 15 minutes prior to the live webcast to ensure adequate time for any software download that may be needed to access the webcast.   a replay of the conference call will be available approximately two hours after the call and accessible through one of the following telephone numbers, using the passcode below:   replay us dial-in number:  1-855-859-2056   replay international dial-in number:  1-404-537-3406   passcode:  35706781   about steadfast   conducted by horizon in partnership with the friedrich's ataxia research alliance (fara), steadfast or safety, tolerability and efficacy of actimmune dose escalation in friedreich's ataxia study enrolled 92 patients at four top fa centers across the country.  the randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase3 study, evaluated patients treated with subcutaneous doses of either actimmune or placebo three times a week for a total of 26 weeks.   the primary endpoint evaluated the effect of actimmune versus placebo on the change from baseline to week 26 in neurological outcome as measured by the modified friedreich's ataxia rating scale (fars--mneuro), a subset of the total fars score that measures objective components of a patient's ability to function such as upper and lower extremity coordination.  the fars is a validated neurological outcome scale, in which higher scores reflect a greater level of disability.  fars-mneuro was determined by experts in the field to be the most clinically relevant instrument for assessing the effects of treatment on fa in this particular trial.  secondary endpoints included observed mean change from baseline to week 26 in activities of daily living (adl), timed 25-foot walk test (t25fw), friedreich's ataxia rating scale (fars) scores, and other neurologic evaluations. in addition to safety and efficacy, the steadfast trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic characteristics of actimmune in people with fa.   about friedreich's ataxia (fa)   fa is a debilitating, life-shortening and degenerative neuro-muscular disorder that affects approximately 4,000 to 6,000 people in the united states.  onset of symptoms can vary from five years old to adulthood, with the childhood onset tending to be associated with a more rapid progression. symptoms include progressive loss of strength and coordination usually leading to wheelchair use; diminished vision, hearing and speech; scoliosis (curvature of the spine); increased risk of diabetes; and a life-threatening heart condition.  most young people diagnosed with fa require mobility aids such as a cane, walker or wheelchair by their teens or early 20's.  there are currently no approved treatments for fa.   about actimmune   actimmune (interferon gamma-1b) is a biologically manufactured protein similar to one the body makes naturally to help prevent infection. actimmune is currently approved by the us food and drug administration (fda) for use in two rare diseases.  it is indicated for reducing the frequency and severity of serious infections associated with chronic granulomatous disease (cgd), a genetic disorder that affects the functioning of some cells of the immune system.  in addition, actimmune is indicated for delaying time to disease progression for patients with severe, malignant osteopetrosis (smo), a genetic disorder that affects normal bone formation.  for more information, please see www.actimmune.com.   actimmune is not indicated for fa.   actimmune important safety information   actimmune is contraindicated in patients who develop or have known hypersensitivity to interferon-gamma, e coli-derived products or any component of the product   actimmune should be used with caution in patients with:    -- pre-existing cardiac conditions, including ischemia, congestive heart       failure or arrhythmia     -- seizure disorders or compromised central nervous system function; reduce        dose or discontinue     -- myelosuppression, or receiving other potentially myelosuppressive agents;       consider dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy     -- severe renal insufficiency     -- age < 1 year   monitoring:    -- patients begun on actimmune before age 1 year should receive monthly       assessments of liver function.  if severe hepatic enzyme elevations       develop, actimmune dosage should be modified     -- monitor renal function regularly when administering actimmune in patients       with severe renal insufficiency; accumulation of interferon gamma-1b may        occur with repeated administration. renal toxicity has been reported in       patients receiving actimmune   pregnancy, lactation, and fertility:    -- actimmune should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit       outweighs the potential risk to the fetus     -- use of actimmune by lactating mothers is not recommended. actimmune or       nursing should be discontinued dependent on the importance of the drug to       the mother     -- long-term effects of actimmune on fertility are not known   drug interactions:    -- concomitant use of drugs with neurotoxic, hematotoxic or cardiotoxic       effects may increase the toxicity of interferons     -- avoid simultaneous administration of actimmune with other heterologous       serum protein or immunological preparations (e.g., vaccines)   adverse reactions:    -- the most common adverse experiences occurring with actimmune therapy are        "flu-like" symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue,        which may decrease in severity as treatment continues, and may be       minimized by bedtime administration of actimmune     -- acetaminophen may be used to prevent or partially alleviate the fever and       headache     -- isolated cases of acute serious hypersensitivity reactions have been       observed in patients receiving actimmune     -- reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevations of ast and/or       alt have been observed during actimmune therapy     -- at doses 10 times greater than the weekly recommended dose, actimmune may       exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions or may cause reversible       neurological effects such as decreased mental status, gait disturbance       and dizziness   visit www.actimmune

replenish trial evaluated four doses of tx-001hr and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. the doses studied were:  17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) 17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) placebo (n = 151) the replenish trial results demonstrated:  tx-001hr estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and tx-001hr estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint. tx-001hr estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and tx-001hr estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo. tx-001hr estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and tx-001hr estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. the estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the fda guidance to identify the lowest effective dose. the incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four tx-001hr doses, meeting the recommendations established by the us food and drug agency’s (fda) draft guidance.1 as outlined in the fda guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the replenish trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12 as compared to placebo.1 the primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. general safety was also

efficacy “we are very pleased that multiple doses of tx-001hr studied in the replenish trial demonstrated these positive results, suggesting that, if approved, this drug product candidate is poised to address the significant demand for bio-identical hormone therapy,” said chief executive officer robert g. finizio. “we have successfully advanced the science for post-menopausal women’s health by finding a way to effectively combine bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone. the need for a bio-identical fda-approved combination therapy has been unanswered for decades, driving women to use unapproved drugs mixed together by independent and community pharmacies that compound these products. we believe that tx-001hr, if approved, will provide women, healthcare providers and pharmacists with a proven safe, effective and insurance reimbursed bio-identical combination product, finally answering that need. we will continue to evaluate these promising data, and look forward to submitting a new drug application for tx-001hr to the food and drug administration as early as the third quarter of 2017.”  the trial also demonstrated a dose response favoring the higher doses of estradiol in combination with progesterone. the availability of multiple doses of tx-001hr would allow for individualized therapy to meet the needs of a diverse population of women.  the most common adverse events (>5 percent) reported on average in all the active treatment groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, breast tenderness, and upper respiratory infection. there was a very low reported incidence of adverse events of somnolence with tx-001hr, in contrast to commercially available oral progesterone where somnolence has been reported as a significant side effect. there were no unexpected safety signals.  the replenish trial evaluated various secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the menopause-specific quality of life (menqol), the clinical global impression scale (cgi), and the responder analysis rate. both tx-001hr estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and tx-001hr estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the secondary endpoints using these tools.  additional efficacy and safety analyses of the replenish trial data are ongoing and therapeuticsmd plans to submit the full replenish trial results for presentation at future scientific meetings and for publication in peer-reviewed journals.  “tx-001hr is the first bio-identical combination hormone therapy of estradiol in combination with progesterone to be evaluated in a large, well-controlled, randomized clinical trial,” said therapeuticsmd chief medical officer sebastian mirkin, m.d. “the replenish trial demonstrated for the first-time safety and robust efficacy for the treatment of hot flashes at multiple doses of tx-001hr. if approved, tx-001hr estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and tx-001hr estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg would provide therapeuticsmd with a complete portfolio to meet the demands of women currently taking unapproved compounded hormones for the treatment of vms, along with the healthcare providers and pharmacies that prescribe and compound these products.”  about tx-001hr  tx-001hr is a novel combination of 17ß-estradiol and natural progesterone under investigation for treating vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. if approved by the fda, tx-001hr would represent the first bio-identical estradiol and progesterone approved for use in a single, combined product for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus offering women an important alternative to both the available fda-approved synthetic (non-bio-identical) hormones and the unapproved compounded bio-identical hormone products. bio-identical refers to estradiol and progesterone that are molecularly identical to the hormones circulating naturally in the woman’s body. an estimated one to two-and-a-half million women in the us are using unapproved, compounded bio-identical hormone therapies to treat vasomotor symptoms.2 leading medical societies and the fda advise that compounded hormone therapies may pose significant risk to women given lack of efficacy and safety data and lack of uniform manufacturing processes.  tx-001hr was developed using therapeuticsmd’s unique symbodatm technology (meaning “similar to the body”), which enables partial and complete solubilization of estradiol and progesterone into medium-chain fatty acid oils often derived from coconut oil.  about menopause and vasomotor symptoms (vms)  menopause is a natural life-stage transition for women with an average onset of 51 years. according to the united states census bureau, approximately 43 million women in the us are of menopausal age (45-64 years).3  as the ovaries stop producing hormones, levels of circulating estrogen decrease, often causing vasomotor symptoms (vms) such as night sweats, hot flashes, and sleep disturbances. vms affect as many as 60-80 percent of all menopausal women.  menopausal women can benefit from hormone therapy (ht), also known as hormone replacement therapy (hrt), which is recognized by key medical societies as the most effective treatment for relief of symptoms related to menopause.

(nasdaq:akao), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (mdr) gram-negative infections, today announced that its lead product candidate, plazomicin, met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the us food and drug administration (fda) and achieved superiority for the european medicines agency (ema) primary efficacy endpoints in the phase3 epic registration trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cuti) and acute pyelonephritis (ap). in addition, in the phase3 care trial in patients with serious infections due to carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae (cre) a lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy, one of the few remaining antibiotics for treatment of infections due to cre.   "we are thrilled with the outcome of both the epic and care clinical trials and the potential opportunity for plazomicin to address many of the multi-drug resistant bacterial infections occurring every day," said kenneth hillan, m.b. ch.b., achaogen's chief executive officer. "we are grateful to the patients and investigators who were involved in both of these studies, and we look forward to seeking plazomicin's approval from fda and ema. we believe that, if approved, plazomicin will provide an important new option in treating mdr infections, including those caused by cre."   achaogen plans to submit a new drug application (nda), which will include epic and care data, to the fda in the second half of 2017. the company also plans to submit a marketing authorization application (maa) to the ema in 2018. in addition, achaogen plans to publicly present detailed results from both the epic and care trials in 2017.   "these data are exceptional and better than i would have expected - plazomicin's superiority in microbiologic cure for patients with cuti at the test-of-cure visit compared to meropenem, a gold standard for treating mdr infections, is impressive. importantly, the safety profile of the drug looks favorable," said james a. mckinnell, assistant professor of medicine at the david geffen school of medicine and la biomed at harbor-ucla. "the data from the care trial provides compelling evidence for plazomicin as a treatment option for serious infections due to cre. the sample size for the care study was small, but the data show a clear trend in favor of plazomicin in terms of efficacy and overall safety compared to colistin. cre infections cause serious morbidity and mortality and seem to be on the rise. based on these data, plazomicin would be a valuable addition to my short list of available treatment options for both empiric and directed treatment of patients, and as a single agent or in combination with other antibiotics."   in the epic trial, plazomicin successfully met the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the fda-specified primary efficacy endpoints, and achieved superiority for the ema-specified primary efficacy endpoints.   results for fda pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat (mmitt) population were as follows:    -- day 5: 88.0% plazomicin vs. 91.4% meropenem (difference -3.4%, 95% ci:       -10.0, 3.1%), indicating statistical non-inferiority     -- test-of-cure: 81.7% plazomicin vs. 70.1% meropenem (difference 11.6%, 95%       ci: 2.7, 20.3%), indicating statistical superiority   results for ema-specified endpoints of microbiological eradication at the test-of-cure visit were as follows:    -- mmitt: 87.4% plazomicin vs. 72.1% meropenem (difference 15.4%, 95% ci:       7.5, 23.2%), indicating statistical superiority     -- me: 90.5% plazomicin vs. 76.6% meropenem (difference 13.9%, 95% ci: 6.3,        21.7%), indicating statistical superiority   phase3 epic trial in patients with cuti: summary of fda and ema primary efficacy endpoints   (* indicates statistical superiority)                               plazomicin        meropenem     difference (%)(a)                                 n/n (%)          n/n (%)           (95% ci) composite endpoint at day                                                -3.4%   5, mmitt (fda)            168/191 (88.0%)  180/197 (91.4%)      (-10.0, 3.1%)  composite endpoint at                                                    11.6%   toc, mmitt (fda)          156/191 (81.7%)  138/197 (70.1%)      (2.7, 20.3%)*  microbiological  eradication at toc,                                                     15.4%   mmitt (ema)               167/191 (87.4%)  142/197 (72.1%)      (7.5, 23.2%)*  microbiological  eradication at toc, me                                                  13.9%   (ema)                     162/179 (90.5%)  134/175 (76.6%)      (6.3, 21.7%)*     ci: confidence interval;

proteon therapeutics announces topline data from phase3 patency-1 clinical trial of investigational vonapanitase in patients with ckd   - trial did not meet primary efficacy endpoint -   - important secondary and tertiary endpoint data and enrollment in second phase3 ongoing -   - conference call scheduled for 8:30 am et -   waltham, mass., dec. 13, 2016 (globe newswire) -- proteon therapeutics, inc. (nasdaq:prto), a company developing novel, first-in-class therapeutics to address the medical needs of patients with kidney and vascular diseases, today announced that its first phase3 clinical trial with investigational vonapanitase, patency-1, did not meet its primary endpoint of improved primary unassisted patency compared to placebo (p=0.254). however, the topline results for the trial's secondary endpoint suggested that vonapanitase may improve secondary patency compared to placebo (p=0.048). data from one of the trial's three tertiary endpoints also suggested vonapanitase may improve unassisted fistula use for hemodialysis (p=0.035) and any use of the fistula (unassisted or assisted) for hemodialysis (p=0.006). adverse events reported for vonapanitase were similar to placebo.    patency-1 evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of vonapanitase in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) receiving or expecting to receive hemodialysis who underwent surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula. the multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 313 patients at 31 medical centers in the united states. patients in the trial were followed for up to one year.   the trial's primary endpoint, primary unassisted patency, is the length of time from fistula surgical creation to the first occurrence of a fistula thrombosis or corrective procedure to restore or maintain patency (blood flow). in patency-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 17% reduction in the risk of primary unassisted patency loss over one year, compared to placebo (p=0.254). at the end of one year, 42% of patients who received vonapanitase retained primary unassisted patency, compared to 31% of placebo-treated patients.   the kaplan-meier curves for primary unassisted patency can be accessed in figure 1: http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/attachmentng/fae4524b-a782-4332-87fd-550fa9fb87c2    patency-1's secondary endpoint, secondary patency, is the length of time from surgical creation until fistula abandonment (final failure). in patency-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 34% reduction in the risk of secondary patency loss over one year, compared to placebo (p=0.048). at the end of one year, 74% of vonapanitase-treated patients maintained secondary patency, compared to 61% of placebo-treated patients.   the kaplan-meier curves for secondary patency can be accessed in figure 2: http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/attachmentng/0e48c0e7-33e4-4053-8ecb-ee40f1dd2248    topline results also included the following tertiary endpoint data:    -- use for hemodialysis. 39.2% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved       unassisted use of their fistula for dialysis, compared to 25.0% of       placebo-treated patients (p=0.035). 63.9% of vonapanitase-treated       patients used their fistula for dialysis (unassisted or assisted),       compared to 44.4% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.006). use for       hemodialysis was defined as continuous use of the fistula for       hemodialysis for at least 90 days or, if hemodialysis was not initiated       at least 90 days prior to the patient's last visit, for at least 30 days        prior to the patient's last visit and in use at the patient's last visit.       unassisted use was defined as use without prior loss of primary       unassisted patency.     -- unassisted maturation. 62.9% of vonapanitase-treated patients reached       unassisted maturation, compared to 53.4% of placebo-treated patients       (p=0.109). unassisted maturation by ultrasound criteria, a tertiary       endpoint, was defined as achieving a vein diameter >=4 millimeters and       blood flow >=500 milliliters per minute by three months without loss of       primary patency.     -- rate of procedures to restore or maintain patency. over one year,       vonapanitase-treated patients had 1.10 procedures per patient per year       versus placebo-treated patients who had 1.48 procedures per patient per       year (p=0.479). procedures included thrombectomy, angioplasty, stent       deployment and surgical revision.   the proportions of patients reporting adverse events (aes) were comparable between the vonapanitase and placebo arms of the study. the most common aes were consistent with medical events experienced by ckd patients undergoing radiocephalic fistula surgery and are summarized in the table below.   proportions of patients experiencing common adverse events                                         vonapanitase   placebo  adverse events                            n=209       n=102 vascular stenosis                         38.3%        40.2%

includes any adverse event that occurred in  at least 5% of patients in either treatment group.     "we are disappointed that the study missed the primary endpoint. however, it appears that vonapanitase had a drug effect and we are encouraged by the secondary patency and fistula use for hemodialysis findings in this trial, both of which we believe are clinically important," said steven burke, m.d., senior vice president and chief medical officer of proteon therapeutics. "we plan to review the full data set from patency-1 and further investigate these findings in our ongoing phase3 clinical trial, patency-2."   "we want to thank the clinical investigators and the patients and their families who volunteered to participate in patency-1.  we have always recognized that this is an important and complex area of clinical development and proteon remains committed to the dialysis patient community," stated timothy noyes, president and chief executive officer of proteon therapeutics. "because of the clinical importance of fistula abandonment and fistula use for hemodialysis to both patients and physicians, we plan to increase the planned enrollment of patency-2 and look for other ways to use these results to guide our development efforts."   as of november 30, 2016, proteon had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale investments of $43.3 million. the company expects these financial resources will be sufficient to fund its operations into the third quarter of 2018 based upon changes to our operating plan that we intend to implement.   conference call and webcast   proteon is hosting a webcast and conference call today, december 13, at 8:30 a.m. et to discuss the topline data from patency-1. to access the conference call, please dial 844-263-8297 (us) or 478-219-0006 (international) with conference id # 35676163. a live, listen-only webcast will also be accessible on the investors & media page of www.proteontx.com, including accompanying slides. a replay of the conference call will be available for two weeks on the proteon website or by dialing 855-859-2056 (us) or 404-537-3406 (international) and using conference id # 35676163.   about patency-1 and patency-2   patency-1 and patency-2 are phase3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease (ckd) receiving or expecting to receive hemodialysis and undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. the studies were designed to evaluate, over one year, whether a single administration of 30 micrograms of vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic fistula patency, the period of time during which a fistula remains open with adequate blood flow to enable hemodialysis. proteon today announced results of patency-1, which enrolled 313 patients at 31 centers in the united states. proteon continues to enroll patients in patency-2, the second phase 3 clinical trial. proteon expects to reach enrollment of 300 patients in this trial at approximately 40 centers in the united states and canada in the first quarter of 2017. proteon expects to report topline results from patency-2 in the second quarter of 2018.   about chronic kidney disease, hemodialysis and vascular access   in the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease (ckd), also known as kidney failure, the kidneys can no longer function to sustain life. the majority of patients with kidney failure undergo chronic hemodialysis, which requires a high-flow vascular access to repeatedly connect the patient's bloodstream to a hemodialysis machine for this life-saving treatment. the preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula, created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery in the lower arm, resulting in a substantial increase in blood flow and vein dilation. no fda approved preventative treatments currently exist to improve fistula patency. 
no benefit observed upon addition of fovista® to monthly lucentis® regimen for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration -  conference call and webcast today, december 12, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. et -  ophthotech corporation (nasdaq:opht) today announced that the pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved in its two pivotal phase3 clinical trials investigating the superiority of fovista® (pegpleranib) anti-pdgf therapy in combination with lucentis® (ranibizumab) anti-vegf therapy compared to lucentis® monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (amd). the addition of fovista® to a monthly lucentis® regimen did not result in benefit as measured by the mean change in visual acuity at the 12 month time point.   “we are very disappointed in the results from these trials, particularly for patients afflicted with wet amd,” commented david r. guyer, m.d., chief executive officer of ophthotech. “we are thankful to the patients and clinical investigators and their staff for participating in the trials. we will continue to analyze the data from these two studies to better understand the trial results.”   the two clinical trials (oph1002 and oph1003) were international, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, controlled phase3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of fovista® administered in combination with lucentis® (fovista® combination therapy) compared to lucentis® monotherapy. in each of these trials, patients were randomized to one of two approximately equal sized treatment groups. the two phase3 trials enrolled an aggregate of 1,248 patients with wet amd. the results from the databases of the two trials were unmasked and analyzed concurrently.   the combined analysis from the two trials (oph1002 and oph1003) showed that patients receiving fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.24 letters of vision on the early treatment of diabetic retinopathy study (etdrs) standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.01 etdrs letters for patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy, a difference of 0.23 etdrs letters. in oph1002, consisting of 619 treated patients, subjects receiving fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.74 letters of vision on the etdrs standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 9.82 etdrs letters in patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of 0.92 etdrs letters (p=0.44). in oph1003, consisting of 626 treated patients, subjects receiving fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 9.91 letters of vision on the etdrs standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.36 etdrs letters in patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of -0.44 etdrs letters (p=0.71). none of these results of the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis were statistically significant.   in the pooled analysis of pre-specified secondary endpoints from both trials, 24.2% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more etdrs letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 22.1% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1002, 25.9% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more etdrs letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 20.0% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1003, 22.5% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more etdrs letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 24.1% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy.   in the pooled analysis, 12.1% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more etdrs letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 11.2% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1002, 12.0% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more etdrs letters at month 12, compared to 12.3% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1003, 12.2% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more etdrs letters at month 12, compared to 10.2% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy.   in addition, in the pooled analysis, 13.5% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12, compared to 13.9% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1002, 13.6% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 13.2% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy. in oph1003, 13.5% of patients receiving fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 14.6% of patients receiving lucentis® monotherapy.   based on a preliminary analysis of the safety data from these two trials, fovista® combination therapy and lucentis® monotherapy were generally well tolerated after one year of treatment. the ocular adverse events more frequently reported in the fovista® combination therapy group compared to the lucentis® monotherapy group were mainly related to the injection procedure. the incidence of reported serious systemic adverse events was generally similar in both treatment groups as was the incidence of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.   conference call information ophthotech's management team will host a live

egalet announces positive topline results from an intranasal human abuse potential study of egalet-002   pr newswire   wayne, pa., dec. 16, 2016   wayne, pa., dec. 16, 2016 /prnewswire/ -- egalet corporation (nasdaq: eglt) ("egalet"), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, today announced positive topline results from a category 3 intranasal human abuse potential (hap) study of egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release oxycodone product candidate which uses egalet's guardian(tm) technology. egalet-002 is in late-stage development for the management of pain severe enough to require daily around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate.   "given that intranasal abuse is the most common form of non-oral oxycodone abuse, these results, having hit the primary endpoint of reduced maximum drug liking, are promising," said bob radie, president and chief executive officer. "we will look to submit the full data for presentation at a medical meeting in 2017."   egalet-002 was designed using a version of egalet's proprietary guardian technology that contains an inner matrix and an exterior shell. this results in tablets with controlled-release properties as well as physical and chemical features that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation, in order to deter common routes of abuse. the physical hardness of the tablet and the gelling effect of the matrix are designed to give egalet-002 its physical and chemical abuse-deterrent characteristics.   the study was a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled 6-period crossover study. the study evaluated the abuse potential of manipulated egalet-002 compared to crushed immediate-release (ir) oxycodone through the nasal route in 46 non-dependent recreational opioid users experienced in nasal insufflation. a comparison to manipulated oxycontin(r) (oxycodone hydrochloride) was also included as an exploratory arm. the study was conducted in accordance with the fda's guidance for industry, abuse-deterrent opioids -- evaluation and labeling (april, 2015), and used more aggressive methods of manipulation for egalet-002 identified from the category 1 in vitro laboratory studies which were needed to get egalet-002 into a snortable form.   the treatment periods included: egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell on), egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell taken off through an additional manipulation step), crushed ir oxycodone 40 mg, manipulated oxycontin 40 mg, manipulated egalet-002 placebo tablet, and placebo powder. the primary study endpoint was drug liking measured on a bipolar 100-point scale, where 50 is neutral, 100 is maximum liking and 0 is maximum disliking.   topline results from the study include:    -- for the primary comparison, the difference in maximum drug liking (emax)        between manipulated egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5) was significantly       lower compared to crushed ir oxycodone (86.6); p = 0.0004            -- this outcome was also significant for the comparison between              manipulated egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4) and crushed ir              oxycodone (86.6); p < 0.0001     -- for the secondary outcome of take drug again (measured on a bipolar       100-point scale), the results were 69.9 for manipulated egalet-002 (shell       on), 72.4 for manipulated egalet-002 (shell off), and 75.5 for crushed ir       oxycodone; not statistically significant for either comparison     -- in the exploratory analysis with oxycontin, emax drug liking was similar        in all treatment arms: manipulated egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5),       manipulated egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4), and manipulated oxycontin        (76.2)            -- ease of snorting and pleasantness of snorting were also assessed              using unipolar 100-point scales where 100 represented 'very              easy'/'very pleasant' and 0 meant 'very hard'/'very unpleasant';              results were as follows:                   -- ease of snorting was significantly harder for manipulated                     egalet-002 (with shell on; 42.0) and manipulated egalet-002                     (with shell off; 49.5) compared to manipulated oxycontin                     (65.1); p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0050, respectively                   -- pleasantness of snorting was significantly lower for                     manipulated egalet-002 (with shell on; 40.7) and                     manipulated egalet-002 (with shell off; 44.7) compared to                     manipulated oxycontin (55.3); p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0081,                     respectively   guardian(tm) technology   egalet's guardian technology has many applications and has been used to develop abuse-deterrent forms of commonly abused prescription medications. egalet's proprietary guardian technology is a polymer matrix tablet technology that utilizes a novel application of the well characterized manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that are more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. this approach offers the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of manipulation. tablets manufactured with guardian technology have been shown to have increased resistance to physical methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking using a variety of tools. they are also resistant to chemical manipulation and extraction and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid, making syringeability very difficult. egalet-002 was designed using a version of egalet's proprietary guardian technology that contains an inner matrix and an exterior shell while arymo er uses a different version of the guardian technology.   about egalet   egalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions. egalet has two approved products: oxaydo(r) (oxycodone hci, usp) tablets for oral use only --cii and sprix(r) (ketorolac tromethamine) nasal spray. in addition, using its proprietary guardian(tm) technology, egalet is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, product candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and chemical manipulation. the lead programs, arymo(tm) er, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and egalet-002, an abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are being developed for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are inadequate. egalet's guardian technology can be applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can be used to develop combination products that include multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles. for additional information on egalet, please visit egalet.com. for full prescribing information on sprix, including the boxed warning, please visit sprix.com. for full prescribing information on oxaydo, please visit oxaydo.com.
