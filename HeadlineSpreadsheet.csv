  RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ:BCRX) today announced results from OPuS-2
(Oral ProphylaxiS-2), a clinical trial of avoralstat administered three
times daily as a liquid-filled soft gel formulation for the prophylactic
treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks.
  In the OPuS-2 study, HAE patients with a historical attack frequency of
greater than 0.45 attacks per week were randomized to treatment with either
500 mg or 300 mg of avoralstat, or placebo, administered three times daily
for 12 weeks.  The primary goals of the trial were to characterize the
efficacy of avoralstat in reducing the frequency of angioedema attacks, and
to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 12 weeks of avoralstat treatment.
The primary efficacy endpoint was angioedema attack frequency.
  Thirty-eight subjects received avoralstat 500 mg, 36 subjects received
avoralstat 300 mg, and 36 subjects received placebo.  Treatment with 500 mg
and 300 mg of avoralstat three times daily failed to demonstrate a
statistically significantly lower mean attack rate versus placebo.  The mean
(standard deviation) attack rates per week were 0.63 (0.57) on avoralstat
500mg, 0.71 (0.66) on avoralstat 300mg, compared to 0.61 (0.41) on placebo.
  ""OPuS-2 was a well-designed and executed trial that gave us a clear answer;
this dosage form of avoralstat is not a viable formulation to move forward,""
said Jon P. Stonehouse, President & Chief Executive Officer.  ""While we are
disappointed in the study results, we learned that meaningfully better
exposure is needed for avoralstat to succeed. We expect results from a
relative bioavailability study testing a novel solid dosage form of
avoralstat by mid-year -- the primary goals of this study are to achieve
much higher exposures and twice daily dosing. Our other opportunity to
achieve higher exposure of an oral kallikrein inhibitor is with BCX7353 - we
expect results from the BCX7353 APeX-1 dose ranging study in HAE patients by
year end.""
  Secondary efficacy endpoints included measures of quality of life, attack
duration and attack severity. Statistically significant improvements in
duration of attacks and in the Angioedema Quality of Life total score, and
its domains, were observed comparing the 500 mg three times a day avoralstat
arm to placebo.
  Oral administration of avoralstat in OPuS-2 was generally safe and well
tolerated; the adverse event profile was similar to that for placebo; and no
safety signals were observed.

  About Avoralstat
  Discovered by BioCryst, avoralstat is a novel, selective inhibitor of plasma
kallikrein in development for prevention of attacks in patients with
hereditary angioedema (HAE). By inhibiting plasma kallikrein, Avoralstat
suppresses bradykinin production. Bradykinin is the mediator of acute
swelling attacks in HAE patients.
  About Hereditary Angioedema
  HAE is a rare, severely debilitating and potentially fatal genetic condition
that occurs in about 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 people. HAE symptoms include
recurrent episodes of edema in various locations, including the hands, feet,
face, genitalia and airway. In addition, patients often have bouts of
excruciating abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting that are caused by swelling
in the intestinal wall. Airway swelling is particularly dangerous and can
lead to death by asphyxiation. Further information regarding HAE can be
found at www.haea.org.
  About BioCryst Pharmaceuticals
  BioCryst Pharmaceuticals designs, optimizes and develops novel small
molecule drugs that block key enzymes involved in rare diseases. BioCryst's
ongoing development programs include oral plasma kallikrein inhibitors for
hereditary angioedema; avoralstat, BCX7353 and other second generation
compounds, and BCX4430, a broad spectrum viral RNA polymerase inhibitor. For
more information, please visit the Company's website at www.BioCryst.com.","BioCryst Announces Results From OPuS-2   RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Feb. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (NASDAQ:BCRX) today announced results from OPuS-2 (Oral ProphylaxiS-2), a clinical trial of avoralstat administered three times daily as a liquid-filled soft gel formulation for the prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks.

  Company to Host Conference Call Today, November 28, at 5:00 p.m. EST
  BOULDER, Colo., Nov. 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nivalis Therapeutics, Inc.
(NASDAQ:NVLS), a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on treating
people with cystic fibrosis (""CF""), today announced topline results from the
Company's Phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of two doses of
cavosonstat, 200 mg and 400 mg, in adult patients with CF who had two copies
of the F508del-CFTR mutation and were being treated with Orkambi(TM). There
were no dose limiting toxicities and cavosonstat was well tolerated at all
doses in the trial. The trial failed, however, to demonstrate benefit in
absolute change in percent predicted FEV(1) , the trial's primary endpoint,
or in sweat chloride reduction at 12 weeks.
  ""While we are disappointed in the outcome of this trial, we plan to continue
to investigate the therapeutic potential of cavosonstat and our
S-nitrosoglutathione reductase (GSNOR) inhibitor portfolio to  determine
next steps,"" said Jon Congleton, president and chief executive officer of
Nivalis.
  Summary of Key Data
  The data announced today are from a Phase 2, double-blind, randomized,
placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that evaluated the efficacy and
safety of two doses of cavosonstat administered twice daily (BID) in adult
patients with CF who were homozygous for the F508del-CFTR mutation and being
treated with Orkambi. The trial included a total of 138 adults who received
treatment with cavosonstat (200 mg) with Orkambi (n=44), cavosonstat (400
mg) with Orkambi (n=48) and placebo with Orkambi (n=46) for 16 weeks. The
trial included a 4-week withdrawal and follow-up period once patients had
completed 12-weeks of dosing.
  The primary endpoint of the trial was change in absolute percent predicted
FEV(1) from baseline to week 12. This and key secondary endpoints are shown
in the table below.

12%, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement (p<0.05) in the
incidence of complete clearance of all baseline warts compared to vehicle
treatment after 12 weeks in both the intent-to-treat and per-protocol
analyses.
  ""These data are impressive. The magnitude of effect with favorable
tolerability provides us great enthusiasm for patients suffering from the
most common sexually transmitted infection in the United States,"" said
Nathan Stasko, PhD, President and Chief Executive Officer of Novan.
""Importantly, SB206 represents another drug candidate from our platform that
has now shown the repeatability of taking a fundamental nitric oxide
mechanism of action, generating compelling preclinical evidence and then
translating that success into statistically significant results in Phase 2
clinical trials. Genital warts was our first viral target, and as we develop
SB206 further we intend to diligently investigate the numerous other viral
skin infections in need of new treatment options.""
  In this randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled clinical trial, the
safety and efficacy of SB206 was evaluated in 107 patients with external
genital warts and perianal warts. The dose and dosing frequency of SB206 was
tested in four independent cohorts in which patients were randomized in a
3:1 ratio to either SB206 or vehicle and treated for up to 12 weeks. SB206
doses included SB206 4% twice-daily, 4% once-daily, 8% once-daily and the
highest dose evaluated, 12% once-daily. Patients eligible for this clinical
trial were males or females, 18 to 50 years of age, with 2 to 20 warts on
the genital or perianal area. The mean wart count burden per patient at
baseline was 7.4 warts.
  The primary endpoint for this clinical trial was the proportion of patients
who were completely clear of warts that were present at baseline at or
before week 12. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 33% of patients achieved
complete clearance of all warts by week 12 when treated with SB206 12%
once-daily, compared to only 4% of patients achieving complete clearance
with vehicle once-daily (p=0.0099). In the per-protocol analysis containing
patients who completed a full 12 weeks of dosing, 42% of patients achieved
complete clearance of all warts when treated with SB206 12% once-daily,
compared to only 7% of patients achieving complete clearance with vehicle
once-daily (p=0.0200).
  The cutaneous tolerability of SB206 was carefully monitored and recorded
using scores on a four-point grading scale for erythema, edema, erosions or
ulcers and burning or stinging. The once-daily treatment arms were generally
well tolerated, including the most effective dose, 12% once-daily. The most
frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events were application site
reactions, the percentage of which was highest in patients treated with
SB206 4% twice-daily. Based on the local application site adverse-event
profile and the Company's strict, pre-specified stopping criteria, SB206 4%
twice-daily was discontinued, and all of the remaining cohorts were dosed
once-daily.
  ""I am honored to be part of the SB206 investigative team, and it was
exciting to observe the clinical benefits that a number of my patients
experienced during the Phase 2 trial,"" said Dr. Valentin Almendarez, Jr.,
board-certified obstetrician and gynecologist at the Institute For Women's
Health in San Antonio. ""I believe that Novan's topical nitric
oxide-releasing gel, SB206, could be a valuable treatment alternative to
existing prescription therapies and locally destructive procedures, with a
mechanism of action that would be truly groundbreaking for the treatment of
viral infections if approved.""
  ""Our SB206 development program now includes in vitro evidence against
high-risk HPV-18 in a human raft cell culture model, in vivo data against
papilloma virus in rabbits, and clinical evidence from our Phase 2 trial
against genital warts commonly caused by HPV-6 and -11,"" said Dr. M. Joyce
Rico, board-certified dermatologist and Chief Medical Officer of Novan. ""The
ability to directly inhibit viral replication suggests that our nitric
oxide-releasing technology may demonstrate activity against a broad spectrum
of HPV strains, including high-risk subtypes associated with cancers of the
head, neck and cervix.""
  Based on the data generated in this Phase 2 dose-ranging trial, Novan
expects to discuss the entirety of the SB206 development program with the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the first half of 2017 and,
assuming a successful end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, plans to initiate
the Company's late-stage program with Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials of
SB206 in the second half of 2017.
  About Human Papillomavirus (HPV) and Genital Warts
  HPV refers to a large family of double-stranded DNA viruses that induce
abnormal growths on the skin or mucosal surfaces. HPV affects nearly 80
million Americans, and an estimated 14 million new cases of the virus are
reported each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, or CDC. There are over 100 subtypes of the virus, characterized
as low-risk or high-risk based on their cancer-causing potential. The virus
is typically transmitted via direct skin-to-skin contact through disruptions
in the normal skin barrier. All warts are caused by HPV, including genital
and perianal warts, common warts and plantar warts.
  Genital warts are among the world's most common sexually transmitted
diseases. Genital warts are usually flesh-colored growths that can be
raised, flat or cauliflower-shaped and are typically found on the surface of
the external genitalia or in and around the anus. In males, they can appear
on the surface of the penis and scrotum, and in females inside the vagina or
on the cervix. Genital warts carry a substantial psychosocial burden due to
the shame and embarrassment related to having a sexually transmitted disease
as well as the inconvenience and discomfort of current treatment modalities.
Current treatment options for genital warts consist of ablative procedures
that cut, burn or freeze the warts but do not address the underlying viral
infection, and there are no currently approved oral or topical prescription
products indicated for the treatment of genital warts with a direct
anti-viral mechanism of action.

  Study Conducted in Young Adults with Type 1 Diabetes and High Baseline A1C
  PR Newswire
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Dec. 5, 2016
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Dec. 5, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) announced top-line results today from a Phase 2 clinical
study of sotagliflozin, a dual SGLT1 and SGLT2 inhibitor, conducted by
Lexicon in collaboration with JDRF, the leading global organization funding
type 1 diabetes research.
  The purpose of this Phase 2 clinical trial, which randomized a total of 87
patients, was to assess the effects of a once-daily 400 mg dose of
sotagliflozin compared to a placebo control in insulin-treated young adults
with type 1 diabetes, aged 18-30 years, and particularly high baseline A1C
levels of greater than or equal to 9.0%, representative of an at-risk
population in which glycemic control and adherence to therapy are
substantial challenges.  The study promoted adherence and encouraged insulin
adjustment as needed to achieve glucose control targets.
  Patients treated with sotagliflozin as an adjunct to insulin had a mean
reduction from baseline in A1C of 1.33% after 12 weeks of treatment.  The
results for the A1C primary endpoint numerically favored sotagliflozin, with
a placebo-adjusted reduction of 0.35%, but did not reach statistical
significance.  A pre-planned subgroup analysis in patients with A1C at
baseline of less than or equal to 10.0% showed a statistically-significant
reduction in this same A1C primary endpoint, with sotagliflozin-treated
patients achieving a mean reduction from baseline in A1C of 1.43% and a
placebo-adjusted reduction of 0.75% (p=0.006).  In secondary measures:
   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved an increase of
approximately
      one-third in the mean proportion of time spent in the target range of
      70-180 mg/dL (from 33.1% at baseline to 43.6% at week 12) as measured by

      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), as compared to a slight reduction
in
      time in the target range (from 33.5% at baseline to 32.9% at week 12)
for
      patients treated with placebo.

   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean placebo-adjusted
      reduction from baseline to week 12 of 56.6 mg/dL in two-hour
      post-prandial glucose (PPG) following a standardized mixed meal.

   -- Patients treated with sotagliflozin achieved a mean reduction of 0.62 kg

      in body weight from baseline to week 12, as compared to an increase of
      1.75 kg in body weight for patients treated with placebo.
  Sotagliflozin was well tolerated in the study, with a smaller proportion of
patients on sotagliflozin experiencing treatment-emergent adverse events
(AEs) (58.1% on sotagliflozin vs. 61.9% on placebo) and serious AEs (SAEs)
(4.7% on sotagliflozin vs. 7.1% on placebo).  There were no discontinuations
from study drug due to AEs on sotagliflozin vs. two patients on placebo.
One patient in the sotagliflozin treated arm and two patients in the placebo
arm experienced a severe hypoglycemia event during the 12-week treatment
period.  No patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a diabetic
ketoacidosis (DKA) event, whereas one placebo-treated patient experienced a
DKA event during the 12-week treatment period and two additional patients
experienced a DKA event during the pre-randomization, placebo run-in period
of the study.  There were no deaths in the study.
  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated favorable safety in this study in an at-risk
population and continues to show evidence of improvements in the quality of
glucose control consistent with its mechanism of action,"" said Pablo
Lapuerta, M.D., Lexicon's executive vice president and chief medical
officer. ""Reductions in post-prandial glucose were consistent with SGLT1
inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract.  Better control of post-prandial
glucose will allow patients with type 1 diabetes to spend more time with
glucose in a better range, with low rates of severe hypoglycemia.""
  ""We applaud the efforts of Lexicon in prioritizing the development of novel
therapies for the multitudes affected by type 1 diabetes.  Individuals with
type 1 diabetes continue to experience challenges of disease burden and high
levels of A1C, and we expect at least a subset of those to benefit from
novel, add-on therapies to elicit additional glycemic and metabolic
benefits,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, Ph.D., associate vice president, Translational
Development and International Partnerships at JDRF.  ""We are looking forward
to seeing new options for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we truly
value our partnership with Lexicon as we drive our vision of a world without
type 1 diabetes.""
  About the JDRF Phase 2 Clinical Trial
  The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2 study randomized 87 patients,
aged 18 to 30, in the United States with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or
multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study
greater than or equal to 9.0%.  The study evaluated a once-daily 400 mg dose
of sotagliflozin, before the first meal of the day, against placebo.  Prior
to randomization, there was a two-week run-in period in which patients
received placebo in addition to insulin.  After completion of the run-in
period, patients were randomized to either sotagliflozin or placebo.  The
mean A1C level at baseline, after the two-week run-in period, was 9.9% in
the sotagliflozin-treated arm and 9.7% in the placebo arm.  Following
randomization, adjustments in insulin doses were made when needed in the
medical judgment of the investigator.  During the 12-week treatment period,
total insulin use increased in the placebo arm and decreased in the
sotagliflozin arm; basal insulin use increased in both the placebo and
sotagliflozin arms, with a greater increase in the placebo arm; and bolus
insulin use decreased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a
greater decrease in the sotagliflozin arm.
  About Sotagliflozin
  Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is
a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for
glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2
(SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by
the kidney.
  Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in
November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize
sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development
activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to
co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in
the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of
sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United
States.
  Lexicon announced positive top-line results of its first pivotal Phase 3
clinical trial of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes, on a
background of optimized insulin (inTandem1), in September 2016.  Lexicon is
conducting a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (inTandem2) from which
top-line results are expected later this month.  A third type 1 diabetes
Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying
approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or
placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin
optimization prior to randomization.  Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3
clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes this
year.

There were no discontinuations from study drug due to AEs on sotagliflozin vs. two patients on placebo. One patient in the sotagliflozin treated arm and two patients in the placebo arm experienced a severe hypoglycemia event during the 12-week treatment period.  No patients treated with sotagliflozin experienced a diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) event, whereas one placebo-treated patient experienced a DKA event during the 12-week treatment period and two additional patients experienced a DKA event during the pre-randomization, placebo run-in period of the study.  There were no deaths in the study.   ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated favorable safety in this study in an at-risk population and continues to show evidence of improvements in the quality of glucose control consistent with its mechanism of action,"" said Pablo Lapuerta, M.D., Lexicon's executive vice president and chief medical officer. ""Reductions in post-prandial glucose were consistent with SGLT1 inhibition in the gastrointestinal tract.  Better control of post-prandial glucose will allow patients with type 1 diabetes to spend more time with glucose in a better range, with low rates of severe hypoglycemia.""   ""We applaud the efforts of Lexicon in prioritizing the development of novel therapies for the multitudes affected by type 1 diabetes.  Individuals with type 1 diabetes continue to experience challenges of disease burden and high levels of A1C, and we expect at least a subset of those to benefit from novel, add-on therapies to elicit additional glycemic and metabolic benefits,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, Ph.D., associate vice president, Translational Development and International Partnerships at JDRF.  ""We are looking forward to seeing new options for individuals with type 1 diabetes, and we truly value our partnership with Lexicon as we drive our vision of a world without type 1 diabetes.""   About the JDRF Phase 2 Clinical Trial   The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 2 study randomized 87 patients, aged 18 to 30, in the United States with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study greater than or equal to 9.0%.  The study evaluated a once-daily 400 mg dose of sotagliflozin, before the first meal of the day, against placebo.  Prior to randomization, there was a two-week run-in period in which patients received placebo in addition to insulin.  After completion of the run-in period, patients were randomized to either sotagliflozin or placebo.  The mean A1C level at baseline, after the two-week run-in period, was 9.9% in the sotagliflozin-treated arm and 9.7% in the placebo arm.  Following randomization, adjustments in insulin doses were made when needed in the medical judgment of the investigator.  During the 12-week treatment period, total insulin use increased in the placebo arm and decreased in the sotagliflozin arm; basal insulin use increased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater increase in the placebo arm; and bolus insulin use decreased in both the placebo and sotagliflozin arms, with a greater decrease in the sotagliflozin arm.   About Sotagliflozin   Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2 (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by the kidney.   Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United States.   Lexicon announced positive top-line results of its first pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin in patients with type 1 diabetes, on a background of optimized insulin (inTandem1), in September 2016.  Lexicon is conducting a second pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (inTandem2) from which top-line results are expected later this month.  A third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400 mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization.  Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes this year.   About Lexicon   Lexicon is a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company that is applying a unique approach to gene science based on Nobel Prize-winning technology to discover and develop precise medicines for patients with serious, chronic conditions. Through its Genome5000(TM) program, Lexicon scientists have studied the role and function of nearly 5,000 genes over the last 20 years and have identified more than 100 protein targets with significant therapeutic potential in a range of diseases.

Time
  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 14, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Atara
Biotherapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:ATRA) today announced results from its Phase 2
proof-of-concept clinical trial for PINTA 745 for the treatment of protein
energy wasting (PEW) in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD). The
trial did not meet its primary endpoint, defined as the percent change from
baseline in Lean Body Mass (LBM) as measured by Dual Energy X-Ray
Absorptiometry (DXA) at week 12 following weekly treatment with PINTA 745.
  PINTA 745 also did not improve physical function, measures of glycemic
control and markers of inflammation. There were no treatment related serious
adverse events observed in the trial.
  ""We are very disappointed that PINTA 745 did not meet the primary endpoint
of this Phase 2 clinical trial. These data are unambiguous and contrast with
prior clinical and preclinical results,"" said Isaac Ciechanover, M.D.
President and Chief Executive Officer of Atara Bio. ""We want to sincerely
thank the patients and investigators for their participation in this trial.""


  As a consequence of these results, Atara Bio will suspend further
development of PINTA 745. To date, third-party direct costs for the
development of PINTA 745 from our inception through the third quarter of
2015 were approximately $10 million.
  The Company will focus its resources on its portfolio of clinical stage
oncology and immunotherapy product candidates, including:
   -- Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte (EBV-CTL),
which
      received breakthrough designation in rituximab refractory EBV associated


      post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders after allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) and is in two ongoing Phase 2
      trials for EBV malignancies;


   -- Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (CMV-CTL), which
      is in two Phase 2 clinical trials for refractory CMV infections that
      occur in patients who have received an alloHCT;


   -- Wilms' Tumor 1 Targeted Cytotoxic T-Lymphocytes (WT1-CTL), which is in
      two ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials assessing safety and initial
      anti-tumor efficacy in patients with hematologic malignancies; and


   -- STM 434, an activin inhibitor, which is in an ongoing Phase 1 clinical
      trial assessing safety and initial anti-tumor efficacy in patients with
      ovarian cancer and other advanced solid tumors.
  Atara ended the third quarter of 2015 with approximately $334.3 million in
cash and cash equivalents and short-term available-for-sale investments,
providing sufficient resources to further advance the Company's oncology and
immunotherapy portfolio, including completion of the ongoing clinical
studies and the planned initiation of two pivotal trials for EBV-CTL.

  -- Neither Study Met Primary Endpoint; Additional Analyses of FORWARD-4
Provide Supportive Evidence of Efficacy --
  -- Third Efficacy Study, FORWARD-5, Will Recruit Additional Patients; Data
May Provide Regulatory Path Forward for ALKS 5461 --
DUBLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--January 21, 2016--
  Alkermes plc (NASDAQ: ALKS) today announced preliminary topline results from
FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, the first two of three phase 3 efficacy studies to
read out from the comprehensive FORWARD pivotal program for ALKS 5461, a
once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action
for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients
who have an inadequate response to standard therapies for clinical
depression. Neither of the two studies met the prespecified primary efficacy
endpoint, which compared ALKS 5461 to placebo on the change from baseline on
the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS).
  FORWARD-4 tested two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 0.5mg/0.5mg)
compared to placebo. 385 patients entered the study. There was a clear trend
toward efficacy with the 2mg/2mg dose of ALKS 5461 on the primary endpoint,
and post hoc analyses achieved statistical significance for the entire
2mg/2mg dose group on the MADRS endpoint. Based on these analyses, Alkermes
believes that FORWARD-4 provides supportive evidence of the efficacy of ALKS
5461 in the treatment of major depressive disorder.
  FORWARD-3 tested ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg) compared to placebo. 429 patients
entered the study. Placebo response was greater than that observed in
FORWARD-4 and no treatment effect of ALKS 5461 was observed. Negative trials
due to significant placebo effect are not uncommon in the study of major
depressive disorder.
  FORWARD-5, the third pivotal efficacy study in the FORWARD program, is
ongoing, testing two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg).
FORWARD-5 shares common design and analysis features with FORWARD-4. Based
on information gained from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4, patient enrollment in
FORWARD-5 will be increased and the statistical analysis plan will be
updated. Alkermes will provide an update later this quarter on the projected
timing of completion of FORWARD-5.
  In the case of a clear positive outcome for FORWARD-5, Alkermes believes
that the evidence provided by it and the previously completed successful,
randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 study, together with supportive
evidence from FORWARD-4, collectively could provide substantial evidence of
efficacy for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD. In that case,
Alkermes would request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Division of Psychiatric Products to discuss the
regulatory path for this Fast Track designated medicine.
  ""We are gaining important insights as we proceed with the FORWARD program
for ALKS 5461. The third pivotal efficacy study, FORWARD-5, is ongoing and
we plan to adapt it to incorporate findings from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4,""
stated Elliot Ehrich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alkermes. ""Clinical
trials of new medicines for the treatment of major depressive disorder are
complicated by significant placebo response. We designed the FORWARD pivotal
program to include three efficacy studies as we recognize that this is a
challenging disease state where multiple clinical studies and expansive
analyses are generally necessary to confirm the efficacy of a new medicine.""

  ""We are steadfast in our commitment to developing new medicines for serious
CNS conditions where there is a clear and compelling need for new treatment
options for patients and their families,"" said Richard Pops, Chief Executive
Officer of Alkermes. ""Major depressive disorder is one of these conditions.
We are building a large body of evidence supporting our belief in the
clinical utility and the novel mechanism of action of ALKS 5461. We await
the results of FORWARD-5 and will determine our next steps along the
regulatory path with those results in hand.""
  In FORWARD-3, the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea,
headache and fatigue, and in FORWARD-4 they were nausea, headache and
dizziness. The safety and tolerability profile of ALKS 5461 was consistent
with that reported for the phase 2 and FORWARD-1 studies.
  About FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4
  FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 are phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter,
placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the safety, tolerability and
efficacy of once-daily ALKS 5461 as adjunctive treatment in patients with
MDD who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
inhibitor (SNRI). The prespecified primary endpoint of both studies was the
change from baseline in MADRS scores. All participants in the double-blind
portion of the study were eligible to continue in an open-label phase and
receive ALKS 5461 for an additional 12 months.
  About the Phase 3 FORWARD Clinical Program
  The FORWARD (Focused On Results With A Rethinking of Depression) pivotal
program for ALKS 5461 includes three core phase 3 efficacy studies, as well
as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing,
pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of ALKS 5461. The primary
efficacy endpoint for the three core efficacy studies is the change from
baseline in Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores.
  Further information about the FORWARD studies can be found at
www.clinicaltrials.gov.
  About ALKS 5461
  ALKS 5461 is a proprietary, oral investigational medicine that acts as a
balanced neuromodulator in the brain and represents a novel mechanism of
action for treating MDD. ALKS 5461 consists of samidorphan and
buprenorphine, and is designed to rebalance brain function that is
dysregulated in the state of depression. In October 2013, the FDA granted
Fast Track status for ALKS 5461 for the adjunctive treatment of MDD in
patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies.
  About MDD
  According to the DSM-5(R)  (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth Edition), major depressive disorder (MDD) is a condition in
which patients exhibit depressive symptoms, such as a depressed mood or a
loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities consistently for at least a
two-week period, and demonstrate impaired social, occupational, educational
or other important functioning. An estimated 17 million people in the U.S.
suffer from MDD in a given year, (1,2)  the majority of whom may not
adequately respond to initial antidepressant therapy.(3)

Pivotal Phase 3 Trials to use Placebo as Comparator

First Phase 3 clinical trial expected to commence in third quarter of 2016

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced the Phase 3 clinical development strategy for its OTX-TP (sustained release travoprost) drug product candidate for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Based on feedback from a recent meeting with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Ocular Therapeutix intends to commence the first of two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016.

The planned trial design for the two Phase 3 clinical trials includes an OTX-TP treatment arm and a placebo-controlled comparator arm that would use a non-drug eluting hydrogel-based intracanalicular depot. The Company does not expect that a timolol comparator or validation arm will be required in the study design and does not expect that eye drops, placebo or active, will be administered in either arm. The Company expects that the FDA will require that OTX-TP show a statistically superior and clinically meaningful reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP), compared to the placebo, as a primary efficacy endpoint.

“We are pleased with the outcome of our recent meeting with the FDA to discuss the Phase 3 clinical development plan for OTX-TP. We believe that a direct comparison of OTX-TP with a placebo comparator reflects the simplest and most real world appropriate clinical study design for this product,” said Amar Sawhney, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “This meeting was an important milestone for advancing this program into the next stage of its development. We expect to initiate the first of two planned Phase 3 clinical trials in the third quarter of 2016 after holding an End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and finalizing the protocol for the trials.”

Robert Noecker, MD, MBA, Ophthalmic Consultants of Connecticut, and Assistant Clinical Professor, Yale University School of Medicine, stated, “Compliance remains a major issue with all current glaucoma eye drop therapies. Sustained release drug candidates such as OTX-TP address this issue directly, and have the potential to put the control back into the hands of the physician by removing the burden on the patient to administer eye drops every single day. In clinical trials to date, OTX-TP has shown a clinically meaningful IOP lowering effect and has not caused hyperemia, or eye redness, a common side effect of topical glaucoma therapies. It offers a preservative-free formulation that appears to be benign to the ocular surface, which can be adversely affected by preservatives used in eye drops for chronic glaucoma therapy. OTX-TP is a product candidate that may offer an important advancement in the treatment of glaucoma.”

About Glaucoma and Ocular Hypertension

Glaucoma and ocular hypertension are chronic, sight-threatening diseases in which elevated levels of intraocular pressure are associated with damage to the optic nerve, which may result in irreversible vision loss. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Ocular hypertension is characterized by elevated levels of intraocular pressure without any optic nerve damage. Patients with ocular hypertension are at high risk of developing glaucoma. In the U.S. alone 2.7 million people suffer from glaucoma. According to IMS Health data, there were 33 million prescriptions and sales of over $2.4 billion of drugs administered by eye drops for the treatment of glaucoma in 2014.

About Sustained Release Travoprost

Sustained Release Travoprost (OTX-TP) is a preservative-free drug product candidate that resides within the canaliculus and delivers the prostaglandin analog travoprost to the ocular surface for up to 90 days. The drug depot is designed to deliver a continuous steady release throughout the treatment period. A fluorescent visualization aid is formulated within the product to enable both the physician and the patient to monitor drug presence throughout the course of therapy.

  LONDON, March 14, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GW Pharmaceuticals plc
(Nasdaq:GWPH) (AIM:GWP) (""GW,"" ""the Company"" or ""the Group""), a
biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and
commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product
platform, announces the positive results of the first pivotal Phase 3 study
of its investigational medicine Epidiolex(R) (cannabidiol or CBD) for the
treatment of Dravet syndrome. In this study, Epidiolex achieved the primary
endpoint of a significant reduction in convulsive seizures assessed over the
entire treatment period compared with placebo (p=0.01). Epidiolex has both
Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) in the treatment of Dravet syndrome, a rare and
debilitating type of epilepsy for which there are currently no treatments
approved in the U.S.
  ""The results of this Epidiolex pivotal trial are important and exciting as
they represent the first placebo-controlled evidence to support the safety
and efficacy of pharmaceutical cannabidiol in children with Dravet syndrome,
one of the most severe and difficult-to-treat types of epilepsy,"" said Orrin
Devinsky, M.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center. ""These data demonstrate that Epidiolex
delivers clinically important reductions in seizure frequency together with
an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, providing the epilepsy
community with the prospect of an appropriately standardized and tested
pharmaceutical formulation of cannabidiol being made available by
prescription in the future.""
  ""The positive outcome of this Phase 3 trial is a significant milestone in
the development of Epidiolex as a potential new treatment for patients
suffering from Dravet syndrome. We are excited about the potential for
Epidiolex to become the first FDA approved treatment option specifically for
Dravet syndrome patients and their families,"" stated Justin Gover, GW's
Chief Executive Officer. ""In light of this positive data, we will now
request a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss our proposed regulatory
submission. We also look forward with excitement to the upcoming results
from the two Phase 3 trials in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and the second
pivotal trial in Dravet syndrome.""
  ""Dravet syndrome is one of the most catastrophic types of epilepsy in
children and safe and effective treatments are desperately needed. We are
thrilled to learn of these positive results, which bring much needed hope to
the children and families who have been living with these debilitating
seizures,"" said Mary Anne Meskis, Executive Director of the Dravet Syndrome
Foundation.
  Study Overview
  The Phase 3 study randomized 120 patients into two arms, Epidiolex
20mg/kg/day (n=61) and placebo (n=59). Epidiolex or placebo was added to
current anti-epileptic drug (AED) treatment regimens. On average, patients
were taking approximately 3 AEDs, having previously tried and failed an
average of more than 4 other AEDs. The average age of trial participants was
10 years and 30 percent of patients were less than 6 years of age. The
median baseline convulsive seizure frequency per month was 13.
  The primary efficacy endpoint was a comparison between Epidiolex and placebo
measuring the percentage change in the monthly frequency of convulsive
seizures during the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week
baseline observation period. In this study, patients taking Epidiolex
achieved a median reduction in monthly convulsive seizures of 39 percent
compared with a reduction on placebo of 13 percent, which was highly
statistically significant (p=0.01). A series of sensitivity analyses of the
primary endpoint confirmed the robustness of this result. The difference
between Epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of treatment
and was sustained during the entire treatment period.
  Results from secondary efficacy endpoints reinforced the overall
effectiveness observed with Epidiolex.
  Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this study. The most common
adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of Epidiolex-treated
patients) were: somnolence, diarrhea, decreased appetite, fatigue, pyrexia,
vomiting, lethargy, upper respiratory tract infection and convulsion.  Of
those patients on Epidiolex that reported an adverse event, 84 percent
reported it to be mild or moderate. Ten patients on Epidiolex experienced a
serious adverse event compared with three patients on placebo. Eight
patients on Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to adverse events compared
with one patient on placebo.
  Further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.
  In addition to this first Phase 3 trial, GW is conducting a second Phase 3
trial in Dravet syndrome which is recruiting 150 patients.
  GW Clinical Trial Programs in Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Tuberous Sclerosis
Complex
  In addition to the Dravet syndrome trials, GW is conducting the largest
global pivotal clinical trial program to date in Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,
another rare and severe form of epilepsy. The first Phase 3 trial is a
placebo-controlled trial of Epidiolex (at a dose of 20 mg/kg) over a 14-week
treatment period and has randomized 171 patients. This trial is expected to
report top-line results in the second quarter of 2016. The second
placebo-controlled trial has randomized a total of 225 patients and is
expected to report top-line results mid-2016. The primary measure of
efficacy in these two trials will be the comparison between Epidiolex and
placebo in the percentage change in number of monthly drop seizures during
the 14-week treatment period compared with the 4-week baseline observation
period.
  Based on the findings of the physician-led expanded access program, GW
continues to identify additional development targets for Epidiolex within
the field of childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. A Phase 3 trial in a third
epilepsy indication, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex, is due to commence
imminently and clinical development in a fourth indication is expected to
commence in the second half of 2016.

  About Dravet Syndrome
  Dravet syndrome is a severe infantile-onset and highly treatment-resistant
epileptic syndrome frequently associated with a genetic mutation in sodium
channels. Onset of Dravet syndrome occurs during the first year of life in
previously healthy and developmentally normal infants. Initial seizures are
often temperature related, severe, and long-lasting. Over time, people with
Dravet syndrome can develop multiple types of seizures, including
tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atypical absences and are prone to bouts of
prolonged seizures called status epilepticus, which can be life threatening.
Risk of premature death including SUDEP (sudden expected death in epilepsy)
is elevated in people with Dravet syndrome. Additionally, the majority will
develop moderate to severe intellectual and development disabilities and
require lifelong supervision and care. There are currently no FDA-approved
treatments and nearly all patients continue to have uncontrolled seizures
and other medical needs throughout their lifetime.
  About Epidiolex (cannabidiol)
  Epidiolex, GW's lead cannabinoid product candidate, is a liquid formulation
of pure plant-derived CBD, which is in development for the treatment of a
number of rare childhood-onset epilepsy disorders. GW has conducted
extensive pre-clinical research of CBD in epilepsy since 2007. This research
has shown that CBD has significant anti-epileptiform and anticonvulsant
activity using a variety of in vitro and in vivo models and has the ability
to treat seizures in acute animal models of epilepsy with significantly
fewer side effects than existing anti-epileptic drugs. To date, GW has
received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for Epidiolex in the treatment
of both Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Additionally, GW has
received Fast Track Designation from the FDA and Orphan Designation from the
European Medicines Agency for Epidiolex for the treatment of Dravet
syndrome. GW is currently evaluating additional clinical development
programs in other orphan seizure disorders.

for Vitaros(R) in Europe and NDA Re-Submission in the U.S. in Q3 2016
  Conference Call / Webcast Today, Monday, March 28, 2016 at 9:00 a.m. ET
  SAN DIEGO, March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Apricus Biosciences, Inc.
(Nasdaq:APRI), a biopharmaceutical company advancing innovative medicines in
urology and rheumatology, today announced top-line results from the Phase 2b
proof-of-concept study of fispemifene in men with secondary hypogonadism and
sexual dysfunction. This study was a randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study enrolling approximately 160 men to assess safety
and tolerability, as well as the ability of fispemifene to improve the
sexual function outcomes of erectile function and low libido compared to
placebo in men with secondary hypogonadism.
  While fispemifene at 450mg demonstrated statistically significant
improvements in total, percent free and percent bioavailable testosterone
compared to placebo (P < 0.0001 at both 4 and 8 weeks), the magnitude of the
increase was not sufficient to achieve statistical significance for either
the erectile function primary endpoint or low libido secondary endpoint.
Erectile function was assessed using the International Index of Erectile
Function erectile function domain (IIEF-EF) questionnaire and Sexual
Encounter Profile (SEP) diaries and low libido/desire was assessed using the
Psychosexual Daily Questionnaire (PDQ).
  Fispemifene was generally well-tolerated, and no new or significant safety
issues arose from this study. Rates of adverse events were similar between
groups with the majority of adverse events being mild or moderate. There
were no serious adverse events experienced on fispemifene and there were
very few discontinuations. There were no elevations in testosterone above
the normal range, and no concerns related to consistent increases in
hemoglobin, hematocrit or prostate-specific antigen.
  ""We are obviously disappointed with these results,"" said Richard Pascoe,
Chief Executive Officer of Apricus. ""As a consequence of these results, we
will discontinue all development of fispemifene in symptomatic secondary
hypogonadism, and focus our resources on our other homegrown pipeline
assets.  Specifically, we will focus on growing ex-U.S. Vitaros(R) revenues,
seeking U.S. Vitaros approval in 2017, and advancing RayVa(TM) with a Phase
2 clinical development program.  We believe that focusing on these higher
return assets, along with streamlining the organization and reducing our
operating expenses, is in the best interest of shareholders.""
  ""While we did see statistically meaningful changes in testosterone levels
into the low normal ranges with fispemifene, the compound's ability to
increase those levels sufficiently to demonstrate clinical benefit is
limited, and may be an issue with the entire SERM class. The regulatory
benchmark for approval of a compound in secondary hypogonadism in men is the
achievement of a symptomatic clinical benefit, using patient-reported
outcome (PRO) measures in a defined patient population. Achievement of
biochemical or PK normalization of testosterone into the low normal range is
not sufficient for regulatory purposes,"" said Barbara Troupin, MD, Chief
Medical Officer of Apricus.

Injection Dosing Strategy for ALD403
  Alder to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Today
  BOTHELL, Wash., March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals,
Inc. (NASDAQ:ALDR), today announced positive top-line data from two clinical
trials evaluating ALD403, Alder's proprietary monoclonal antibody product
candidate for migraine prevention that targets calcitonin gene-related
peptide (CGRP). Positive top-line data from a Phase 2b study of patients
with chronic migraine demonstrated that ALD403 acted rapidly and prevented
migraine over the entire 12 week study period, meeting both primary and
secondary efficacy endpoints.  Additionally, positive Phase 1 study data
demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics by intravenous
(IV), subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular (IM) injection of ALD403 support a
quarterly single injection dosing strategy.
  Randall C. Schatzman, Ph.D., president and chief executive officer of Alder,
commented: ""Today's ALD403 Phase 2b data confirm and expand on our previous
data demonstrating robust efficacy in migraine prevention in a severely
afflicted patient group. Evaluation of ALD403 continues to exhibit a
potential best-in-class profile, which includes immediate, significant and
durable migraine prevention with infrequent quarterly dosing. Today's data
also support our quarterly dosing strategy via a single intravenous,
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. With our commitment to the
accelerated development of ALD403 reinforced by today's positive results, we
look forward to advancing our development plan, and assuming FDA approval,
independently marketing ALD403 in the U.S. to meet the critical medical
needs of the 13 million patients nationwide who are candidates for migraine
prevention therapy.""
  Phase 2b Clinical Trial Evaluating ALD403 in Patients with Chronic Migraine
  The Phase 2b clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized, single intravenous infusion, dose ranging study in patients with
chronic migraine. Patients were randomized to receive a single intravenous
infusion of 10 mg, 30 mg, 100 mg or 300 mg of ALD403 or placebo
(approximately 120 patients per group). The primary efficacy endpoint of the
study is the change in migraine days between ALD403 and placebo as
determined by the 75% responder rates over a 12-week period. Endpoints will
also be evaluated at week 24 (expected Q3 2016) and at week 48 (end of
study).
  Chronic migraine sufferers are defined as individuals who experience 15 or
more headache days per month, of which at least 8 must be assessed as
migraine days.
  Key Points
   -- The 300 mg and 100 mg dose levels of ALD403 met the primary efficacy
      endpoint of the study, a 75% reduction in migraine days over the entire
      12 weeks in 33% and 31% of patients, respectively (p < 0.05).

  *(p= < 0.05)   **(p= < 0.01)
   -- A single administration of ALD403 resulted in an immediate and durable
      mean reduction in migraine days from baseline throughout the 12 weeks at


      the 300 mg (p < 0.01), 100 mg (p < 0.01) and 30 mg (p < 0.05) dose
levels,
      meeting the secondary efficacy endpoint.


   -- A single administration of ALD403 at 300mg, 100mg or 30mg dose levels
      demonstrated a durable reduction in migraine days for the entire 12
weeks,
      supporting a quarterly dosing strategy.


   -- The 10 mg dose of ALD403 was identified as sub-therapeutic.


   -- The safety profile was consistent with earlier ALD403 clinical trials.
  Phase 1 Clinical Trial Evaluating Multiple Doses of ALD403 in Healthy
Volunteers
  The Phase 1 clinical trial is a placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-dose,
double dummy, quarterly-dosing study comparing the intravenous, subcutaneous
and intramuscular routes of administration in healthy volunteers. Sixty
healthy volunteers, 12 in each group, were randomized as follows:
  -- 100 mg ALD403 IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  -- 100 mg ALD403 SC, placebo IM, placebo IV
  -- 100 mg ALD403 IV, placebo IM, placebo SC
  -- 300 mg ALD403 IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  -- Placebo IM, placebo SC, placebo IV
  Individuals were dosed on Day 1 and at Week 12.
  The study evaluated pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic endpoints for the
administration of ALD403 delivered via each of the three routes of
administration.
  Key Points
   -- ALD403 provided a comparable level of suppression of peripheral CGRP
      biology for a full 3 months when administered via a single intravenous
      (100 mg), subcutaneous (100 mg) or intramuscular injection (100 mg or
300
      mg).


   -- ALD403 administered via subcutaneous or intramuscular routes of
      administration had an approximately 80% bioavailability relative to an
      intravenous infusion.


   -- Local tolerability via all modes of administration was excellent.


   -- The safety profile was consistent with earlier ALD403 clinical trials.


   -- The data support a quarterly dosing strategy as a single injection by
all
      modes of administration.
  The results of this study provide an important bridge between
pharmacodynamic monitoring via peripheral CGRP blockade and migraine
prevention: doses (100mg and 300mg) that provided for a full 3 months of
migraine prevention in the Phase 2b study of chronic migraine patients also
provided 3 months of suppression of peripheral CGRP biology independent of
route of administration.
  Additional results, including future analysis of additional secondary
endpoints, from both of these trials are expected to be presented at
upcoming medical meetings and published in peer-reviewed medical journals.

  About ALD403
  ALD403 is a genetically engineered monoclonal antibody that inhibits
calcitonin gene-related peptide, or CGRP, for prevention of migraine. CGRP
is a small protein with a well-established role in the initiation,
mediation, transmission and heightened sensitivity to pain experienced in
migraine. ALD403 was discovered by Alder scientists and has been evaluated
in multiple clinical trials evaluating approximately 800 patients. In a
proof-of-concept clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic
migraine, ALD403 demonstrated significant prevention of migraines, including
complete migraine relief (100% suppression of migraine occurrence) in 27% to
41% of patients in any given month. Migraines were completely prevented in
16% of patients for the entire three-month study period. ALD403 also has a
favorable emerging safety profile, demonstrating a similar level of safety
to placebo, and has been well-tolerated in studies to date. Alder initiated
its late-stage clinical trial program in October 2015 with PRevention Of
Migraine via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 1 (PROMISE 1), a pivotal
clinical trial evaluating patients with frequent episodic migraine. Alder
plans to initiate a second pivotal clinical trial, PRevention Of Migraine
via Intravenous ALD403 Safety and Efficacy 2 (PROMISE 2), in patients with
chronic migraine in the second half of 2016. Also in 2016, Alder further
plans to enter late-stage clinical development of a self-injected
formulation of ALD403 to complement the infusion formulations evaluated in
the PROMISE 1 and 2 trials.
  About Migraine
  Migraine is a common neurological disorder that results in suffering caused
by intense sharp or throbbing pain in the head, commonly accompanied by
nausea, vomiting and high sensitivity to light and sound. Over time,
patients may be subject to an increasing frequency and severity of migraine
attacks, potentially leading to significant disability.
  The Migraine Research Foundation estimates that 36 million American adults
and children suffer from migraines. According to the American Migraine
Foundation, migraine is three times more common in women than men and
affects 30% of women over a lifetime. Migraines can severely restrict normal
activities and often make holding a job or maintaining a normal lifestyle
difficult. The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose
more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days
due to migraine.
  Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta
blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate and botulinum
toxin, or Botox. Medication side-effects, such as cognitive impairment,
nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance, often limit the use of migraine
medications, according to the American Migraine Foundation. The U.S. Agency
for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that only about 12% of adults
with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications.
Alder believes this creates a significant unmet medical need for new
treatments with improved safety and efficacy that can either prevent
migraines completely or reduce the frequency to a level where patients can
find adequate relief from existing abortive medications.","Alder Reports Phase 2b Trial of ALD403 Meets Primary and Secondary Endpoints Demonstrating Migraine Prevention in Patients with Chronic Migraine   Alder Also Reports Positive Phase 1 Data Supporting Quarterly Single Injection Dosing Strategy for ALD403   Alder to Host Conference Call at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time Today   BOTHELL, Wash., March 28, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc.

Also in 2016, Alder further plans to enter late-stage clinical development of a self-injected formulation of ALD403 to complement the infusion formulations evaluated in the PROMISE 1 and 2 trials.   About Migraine   Migraine is a common neurological disorder that results in suffering caused by intense sharp or throbbing pain in the head, commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting and high sensitivity to light and sound. Over time, patients may be subject to an increasing frequency and severity of migraine attacks, potentially leading to significant disability.   The Migraine Research Foundation estimates that 36 million American adults and children suffer from migraines. According to the American Migraine Foundation, migraine is three times more common in women than men and affects 30% of women over a lifetime. Migraines can severely restrict normal activities and often make holding a job or maintaining a normal lifestyle difficult. The Migraine Research Foundation estimates U.S. employers lose more than $13 billion each year as a result of 113 million lost work days due to migraine.   Currently, preventive medications approved for migraine include beta blockers (such as propranolol), topiramate, sodium valproate and botulinum toxin, or Botox. Medication side-effects, such as cognitive impairment, nausea, fatigue and sleep disturbance, often limit the use of migraine medications, according to the American Migraine Foundation. The U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality reports that only about 12% of adults with frequent episodic or chronic migraine take preventive medications. Alder believes this creates a significant unmet medical need for new treatments with improved safety and efficacy that can either prevent migraines completely or reduce the frequency to a level where patients can find adequate relief from existing abortive medications.",,45%

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 31, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genocea Biosciences,
Inc. (NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed
vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive 12 month efficacy
data from its Phase 2 dose optimization trial evaluating GEN-003 for the
treatment of genital herpes. GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and
statistically significant reductions compared to baseline in the rate of
viral shedding 12 months after dosing across multiple dose groups as well as
sustained efficacy at multiple dose levels across secondary endpoints
measuring the impact on clinical disease. GEN-003 was safe and well
tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events related to the vaccine
in the trial.
  ""We are very pleased with these data, which show that GEN-003 has strong and
durable effects on both HSV-2 viral activity and genital herpes clinical
disease, supporting our belief that GEN-003 could become a cornerstone
treatment for patients affected by this serious disease. Specifically, a
single course of treatment of GEN-003 may offer benefits similar to a full
year of daily administration of oral antivirals -- but with greatly improved
convenience,"" said Chip Clark, president and chief executive officer of
Genocea. ""We anticipate reporting virologic efficacy data for GEN-003 from
our recently-initiated Phase 2b study in the third quarter of 2016, clinical
efficacy data at 6 months post dosing around the end of 2016 and conducting
our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017.""
  ""These 12 month data highlight the potential of GEN-003 to significantly
enhance the genital herpes treatment landscape,""  said Lori A. Panther,
M.D., MPH, infectious diseases specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School.
""Because of the physical and psychological impact of this disease, both
patients and treating physicians would be eager to use an effective
treatment that more conveniently improves control of outbreaks. The
reduction in viral shedding, which is thought to cause the epidemic spread
of genital herpes, is also encouraging.""
  Genocea has already advanced the two most promising doses, 60 ug per protein
combined with either 50 or 75 ug of Matrix-M2(TM)  adjuvant, from this Phase
2 dose optimization study into an ongoing Phase 2b efficacy trial. The
efficacy of GEN-003 at these two dose levels over the course of the Phase 2
dose optimization trial is as follows:

  About the GEN-003 Phase 2 Clinical Trial
  This Phase 2 study enrolled 310 subjects from 17 institutions in the United
States. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30 ug
or 60 ug per protein paired with one of three adjuvant doses (25 ug, 50 ug,
or 75 ug). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses
of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and
genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day
observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56
genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of
HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present.
This 28-day observation period was repeated immediately after the completion
of dosing and at six and, twelve months following dosing. No booster doses
were given. After the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing,
patients in the placebo arm were rolled over across the 6 active
combinations of GEN-003 and Matrix-M2 under a separate protocol.

  About GEN-003
  Inducing a T cell response against HSV-2 is critical to treating the
clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the infection.
GEN-003 is a first-in-class T-cell directed immunotherapy designed to elicit
both a T cell and B cell (antibody) immune response. The immunotherapy was
designed using Genocea's ATLAS(TM) platform, which profiles the
comprehensive spectrum of actual T cell responses mounted by humans in
response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive T cell response.
GEN-003 includes the antigens ICP4 and gD2 along with Matrix-M2(TM)
adjuvant, which Genocea licenses from Novavax, Inc. For more information

  About Genital Herpes
  Genital Herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes
recurrent, painful genital lesions. It can be transmitted to sexual
partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. Current genital herpes
therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a
process which drives disease transmission. Incomplete control of genital
lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of
taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management.
Immunity through T cells is believed to be particularly critical to the
control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.
  About Genocea
  Genocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing
vaccines and immunotherapies. T cells are increasingly recognized as a
critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases,
but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets
of such protective immune response. Using ATLAS, its proprietary technology
platform, Genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid
development of medicines to address critical patient needs. Genocea's
pipeline of novel clinical stage T cell-enabled product candidates includes
GEN-003 for genital herpes, GEN-004 for the prevention of infection by all
serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data
analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in
chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis, malaria and cancer immunotherapy. For

  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, April 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Repros Therapeutics
Inc.(R) (Nasdaq:RPRX) today reported that vaginal administration of
Proellex(R) at doses of both 6 and 12 mg achieved significant reduction in
excessive menstrual bleeding, the key symptom of uterine fibroids.
  Normal menstrual blood loss in a menstrual cycle is approximately 35 mL.
Woman experiencing blood loss of >80 mL are considered to suffer from
menorrhagia or excessive menstrual bleeding. In this small Phase 2b study,
13, 15 and 14 women with confirmed uterine fibroids were enrolled in the
6mg, 12mg and placebo arms, respectively. At baseline, the mean amount of
blood lost for one menstrual cycle was 255 mL, 274 mL and 238 mL for each
arm, respectively. The blood loss ranged from a low of 94 mL to a high of
654 mL. The most severe menstrual bleeding at baseline was observed in the
12 mg group. Blood loss was determined by collecting all sanitary products
used from an individual and then an alkaline hematin assay was performed to
estimate the actual amount of blood collected in the pads.
  When a sufficient concentration of Proellex(R) is achieved in circulation,
amenorrhea (cessation of menses) is achieved. Just over half, 52%, of
Proellex(R) -treated subjects became amenorrheic with no evidence of a dose
effect. All subjects treated with Placebo continued to menstruate throughout
the 18 week dosing period. The p-value for this comparison is 0.0011.
Bleeding diaries consistently report a statistically significant difference
in the number of days of bleeding and bleeding intensity between those
treated with Proellex(R) and Placebo.
  Bleeding was also evaluated by PBAC (Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart).
Subjects tallied sanitary product usage and stain size as guided by the
chart.  Proellex(R) -treated subjects reported a median 100% reduction in
PBAC scores while Placebo-treated subjects reported a 25.4% reduction,
further supporting the treatment affect associated with bleeding (p=0.0033).

  Along with changes in menstrual patterns, fibroids measured by MRI were
reduced in volume in the Proellex(R) -treated arms by 18% while the Placebo
group showed continued increase in size, p= 0.0437.
  The drug was generally well tolerated. Women in the drug arms continued to
exhibit levels of estradiol consistent with bone preservation.
  After the first 18 week treatment period, the women were withdrawn from drug
to allow for menses. The women in the study are currently being treated with
the second course of treatment for another 18 weeks. The study treatment
assignment remains blinded to the subjects, physicians and those managing
the study and data. The results of the second course of treatment should be
reported within the next 5 months.
  The Company believes Proellex(R) represents a significant advantage over
GnRH agonists and antagonists in the treatment of uterine fibroids. Once
both the vaginal and oral studies complete both 18 week courses of treatment
the Company plans to request an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to
jointly discuss plans for Phase 3.

Primary endpoint for ocular itching not achieved

Conference call today at 8:30 am Eastern Time

Ocular Therapeutix, Inc. (NASDAQ:OCUL), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced topline results from its second Phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA™ (sustained release dexamethasone) Intracanalicular Depot for the treatment of ocular itching associated with chronic allergic conjunctivitis. DEXTENZA is a product candidate administered by a physician as a bioresorbable intracanalicular depot and designed for drug release to the ocular surface for up to 30 days.

The single primary endpoint of the trial, defined as the difference in the mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo comparator group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots, was not achieved. While mean ocular itching was seen to be numerically lower (more favorable) in the DEXTENZA treatment group compared to the placebo group measured 7 days following insertion of the depots, at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -0.18, -0.29, and -0.29 units, respectively, on a five point scale, this difference did not reach statistical significance. In addition, the trial did not achieve the requirement of at least a 0.5 unit difference at all three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots and at least a 1.0 unit difference at the majority of the three time points between the treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots.

The trial also assessed conjunctival redness as a secondary endpoint. The differences in the mean scores in conjunctival redness between the DEXTENZA treatment group and the placebo group 7 days following insertion of the depots at 7, 15 and 20 minutes were -0.35, -0.39 and -0.42, respectively, compared with values of -0.26, -0.32 and -0.41, respectively, at the same time points 7 days following insertion of the depots in the first Phase 3 trial.

The results from the second Phase 3 trial contrast with those achieved in the first Phase 3 clinical trial of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis announced in October 2015, in which the primary endpoint of treatment of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved, with mean ocular itching scores being lower in the DEXTENZA group at 3, 5, and 7 minutes by -1.02, -0.87, and -1.04 units, respectively (p<0.0001), 7 days following insertion of the depots.

In the second Phase 3 clinical trial, as well as other DEXTENZA clinical trials completed to date regardless of indication, DEXTENZA has exhibited a strong safety profile and has been generally well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events observed in the second Phase 3 clinical trial.

“We are disappointed that the primary endpoint of ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was not achieved in our second Phase 3 trial in these patients, and this result is inconsistent with what we saw in our first Phase 3 trial,” said Amar Sawhney, Ph.D., President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman. “We are currently in the process of conducting a thorough analysis of the data from the second Phase 3 trial to fully understand the difference in efficacy between the two Phase 3 trials. There was a greater variability in ocular itching exhibited by patients in the second Phase 3 trial over the multiple allergen challenges 7, 14 and 28 days following insertion of the depots, compared to the first Phase 3 trial. In a post hoc analysis, when ocular itching scores were averaged over these multiple visits, a statistically significant reduction of symptoms over the entire 1 month intended duration of sustained release, single dose therapy was observed in the DEXTENZA treatment group relative to the placebo vehicle group. Since this analysis was not part of the original end points, we plan to meet with the FDA to discuss the results and chart an appropriate path forward for the development of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis.”

Dr. Sawhney continued, “We remain confident in the potential of our innovative sustained release platform to address diverse applications in ophthalmology. We look forward to the July 2016 PDUFA date for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain.”

Second Phase 3 Study Design

This Phase 3 prospective, U.S.-based multicenter, 1:1 randomized, double-masked, vehicle-controlled trial in 86 patients was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of DEXTENZA™ (sustained release dexamethasone), Intracanalicular Depot for the treatment of signs and symptoms of chronic allergic conjunctivitis. This was the second Phase 3 trial which evaluated DEXTENZA versus a placebo vehicle punctum plug using Ophthalmic Research Associate’s modified Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (Ora-CAC®) Model (Ora, Inc., Andover, MA), which accommodates for the longer therapeutic effect of a seasonal one-time administered drug product.

The trial was designed to assess the effect of DEXTENZA compared with placebo on allergic reactions. DEXTENZA or placebo was administered 48 to 72 hours after the first set of allergen challenges confirming the appropriate allergen and dose exposure to incite an allergic response, followed by three series of successive allergen challenges over a 30 day period. The primary efficacy endpoint evaluated was the difference in mean scores in ocular itching between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots. The trial also included a secondary efficacy endpoint for conjunctival redness which evaluated the difference in mean scores in conjunctival redness between the treatment group and the placebo vehicle group at three time points 7 days following insertion of the depots.

Ocular Therapeutix reported topline results of its first Phase 3 allergic conjunctivitis clinical trial with DEXTENZA in October 2015, where the primary endpoint for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis was successfully achieved and the primary endpoint for conjunctival redness was not achieved.

About Allergic Conjunctivitis

Allergic conjunctivitis is an inflammatory disease of the conjunctiva resulting primarily from a reaction to allergy-causing substances such as pollen or pet dander. The primary symptom of this inflammation is acute ocular itching and the primary sign is conjunctival redness. Allergic conjunctivitis ranges in clinical severity from relatively mild, common forms to more severe forms that can cause impaired vision. According to a study on the management of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis published in 2012 in the peer-reviewed journal Acta Ophthalmologica, allergic conjunctivitis affects 15% to 40% of the U.S. population. For patients with chronic or more severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis, antihistamines and mast cell stabilizers are often not sufficient to treat their signs and symptoms. Many ocular allergy sufferers are not responsive to the conventional dual-acting antihistamine/mast cell stabilizers. These refractory patients are frequently treated with topical corticosteroids administered by eye drops.

About the Modified Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (Ora-CAC®) Model

The modified Ora-CAC® model used in the recently completed clinical trial has been developed to study the interactions between the early and late phases of the allergic response in the eye, and to evaluate the effects of pharmaceutical intervention. The modified Ora-CAC® model utilizes four challenges conducted over a 2-day interval to evaluate the effectiveness of a test agent to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction, as well as evaluate the test agent’s ability to prevent an acute ocular allergic reaction in the presence of subclinical late phase inflammation.

Adult Focal Onset Seizures
  Conference Call Today at 8:00 a.m. ET
  RADNOR, Pa., June 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:MRNS), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of
innovative therapeutics to treat epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders,
today announced top-line results from its Phase 3 clinical trial in adults
with drug-resistant focal onset seizures.  In this trial, ganaxolone did not
meet the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant
difference from placebo. Consistent with previously conducted studies,
ganaxolone was generally safe and well tolerated.  Marinus plans to
discontinue its program in adult focal onset seizures and focus its efforts
on advancing ganaxolone in status epilepticus and pediatric orphan
indications.
  Christopher M. Cashman, chief executive officer of Marinus Pharmaceuticals,
commented, ""We are disappointed with the outcome of this study, and the
unfortunate impact on the epilepsy community and particularly the patients
suffering from drug-resistant focal onset seizures who are benefiting from
ganaxolone treatment. We remain confident in the safety profile of
ganaxolone and its ability to effectively reduce seizures in targeted
patient populations.  We are committed to building our ganaxolone franchise
and are confident in the potential of ganaxolone in the treatment of status
epilepticus and pediatric orphan seizure and behavior disorders. We will
provide an update in the upcoming weeks on our clinical programs in these
indications.""
  The study missed its primary endpoint of percent change in the 28-day
seizure frequency from baseline (p=0.1537). The median percent reduction of
focal onset seizures in the ganaxolone group was 21.28% compared to 10.25%
with placebo during the titration and the 12-week treatment period.
  The safety profile of ganaxolone in this study was consistent with
previously conducted studies.  Overall, ganaxolone was generally safe and
well tolerated with no imbalance between the ganaxolone and placebo group in
the number of patients with serious adverse events reported (5% vs. 5.1%).
The most common adverse events (>5%) reported at greater rates than placebo
were somnolence (23.5% vs 4.5%), dizziness (19.6% vs 4.5%) and fatigue
(11.7% vs 6.8%). The majority of these adverse events were rated as mild in
severity. There were 44 (25%) patients on ganaxolone that discontinued the
study compared to 26 (14%) patients on placebo. The most common reason for
discontinuation was adverse event.
  The Phase 3 multi-national, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled
study was conducted at 61 sites in the United States, Germany, Poland,
Australia, Bulgaria and Russia.  The study randomized 359 patients into two
arms, ganaxolone 1800 mg/day (n=179) and placebo (n=180). The mean age of
the study population was 41 with 63% percent of the participants being
female. Mean years since epilepsy diagnosis was 24.5 years.  76% of the
patients were receiving two or more concomitant AED's and 12% had been
treated with Vagus Nerve Stimulator.
  Dr. Albena Patroneva, chief medical officer of Marinus Pharmaceuticals,
commented, ""The design, conduct, patient demographics and median separation
versus placebo were similar to our positive Phase 2 trial and other studies
conducted with recently approved antiepileptic drugs. While we did not see
the incremental efficacy at a higher dose that we were hoping to achieve,
ganaxolone continued to display a good safety profile -- a key attribute for
the product's future development. We will leverage the findings from this
study in the conduct of our ongoing and future studies in pediatric orphan
indications and status epilepticus.""

  About Drug-Resistant Epilepsy
  Epileptic seizures require chronic treatment, often over a lifetime.
Available antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are efficacious for many patients, but
chronic treatment is complicated by side effects, including cardiovascular
risks, liver enzyme induction, kidney stones, behavioral changes, sedation
and adverse effects on cognitive function, drug tolerance, and reproductive
risk. According to Decision Resources, in 2014 approximately five million
people were under treatment for epilepsy in the United States, Europe and
Japan. Despite the many available AEDs, approximately 30 to 35% of patients
do not attain acceptable seizure control either with a single AED or
polypharmacy. Furthermore, medications with significant side effects or
dosing regimens that undermine compliance make it difficult for patients to
achieve and maintain seizure free status. For these reasons there is a need
for new AEDs with novel mechanisms of action and improved side effect
profiles that can maintain seizure control with chronic administration for
people with drug-resistant epilepsy.
  About Ganaxolone
  Ganaxolone is a CNS-selective GABA(A) modulator being developed in three
different dose forms (IV, capsule, and liquid) intended to maximize
therapeutic reach to adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute
and chronic care settings. Ganaxolone acts on a well-characterized synaptic
and extrasynaptic GABA(A)  target known for anti-seizure and anti-anxiety
activity. Ganaxolone has been studied in more than 1,300 subjects, both
pediatric and adult, at therapeutically relevant dose levels and treatment
regimens for up to two years. In these studies, ganaxolone was generally
safe and well tolerated, with the most commonly reported adverse events of
somnolence, dizziness and fatigue.
  About Marinus Pharmaceuticals
  Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to
the development of ganaxolone, which offers a new mechanism of action,
demonstrated efficacy and safety and convenient dosing, to improve the lives
of patients suffering from epilepsy and neuropsychiatric disorders.
Ganaxolone is a CNS-selective GABA(A) modulator that acts on a
well-characterized target in the brain known to have both anti-seizure and
anti-anxiety effects. Ganaxolone is being developed in three different dose
forms (IV, capsule and liquid) intended to maximize therapeutic reach to
adult and pediatric patient populations in both acute and chronic care
settings. Ganaxolone IV is planned to enter clinical trials in 2016 and is
being developed to treat status epilepticus. Ganaxolone IV is complemented
by its oral dose forms, providing the potential for IV-to-oral continuation
therapy for patients transitioning from acute care to outpatient settings.
Ganaxolone capsule and liquid are being studied in orphan pediatric
indications with comorbidities in seizures and behavior disorders -- PCDH19
epilepsy and Fragile X Syndrome. For more information visit

  WALTHAM, Mass., June 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc.
(NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today
announced that the Phase 3 NOVA trial of niraparib successfully achieved its
primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). This trial demonstrated
that niraparib significantly prolonged PFS compared to control among
patients who are germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) carriers, among patients
who are not germline BRCA mutation (non-gBRCAmut) carriers but who have
homologous recombination deficient (HRD) tumors as determined by the Myriad
myChoice(R) HRD test, and overall in patients who are not germline BRCA
mutation carriers.

  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that enrolled more than 500 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.
There is currently no therapy approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for maintenance treatment of patients with recurrent ovarian
cancer following response to platinum.
  ""We are extremely grateful to the patients, caregivers, and investigators
who participated in the NOVA trial. The results of this study, which is the
first successful, prospectively designed, randomized, well-controlled Phase
3 study of a PARP inhibitor, demonstrate that a single, daily, oral dose of
niraparib is superior to control in prolonging PFS in women with recurrent
ovarian cancer,"" said Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D., President and COO of TESARO.
""Importantly, these results show activity of niraparib in a population of
ovarian cancer patients beyond those with germline BRCA mutations. In
keeping with our mission of responsible drug development, NOVA was designed
to define those patients most likely to benefit from niraparib treatment
and, in so doing, optimize the benefit/risk profile for patients. We believe
we have achieved that goal and look forward to presentation of the full data
set from this study at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
congress in October.""
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the gBRCAmut Cohort
  Among patients who were germline BRCA mutation carriers, the niraparib arm
successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the
primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.27. The median PFS for
patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared to 5.5 months for
control (p < 0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in non-gBRCAmut Cohort for Patients
with HRD Positive Tumors
  For patients who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers but whose tumors
were determined to be HRD positive using the Myriad myChoice(R) HRD test,
the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the
control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.38.
The median PFS for patients with HRD-positive tumors who were treated with
niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for control (p < 0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the Overall non-gBRCAmut Cohort
  Niraparib also showed statistical significance in the overall non-germline
BRCA mutant cohort, which included patients with both HRD-positive and
HRD-negative tumors. The niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical
significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a
hazard ratio of 0.45. The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was
9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control (p < 0.0001).
  The most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events among
all patients treated with niraparib were thrombocytopenia (28.3%), anemia
(24.8%) and neutropenia (11.2%). Adverse events were generally managed via
dose modifications. The discontinuation rate was 14.7% for niraparib treated
patients and 2.2% for control. The rates of MDS/AML in the niraparib (1.3%)
and control (1.2%) arms were similar. There were no deaths among patients
during study treatment.
  ""The majority of women who are diagnosed with advanced ovarian cancer will
experience a relapse of their disease, even if they respond to their initial
chemotherapy,"" said Dr. Tom Herzog, M.D., Clinical Director, University of
Cincinnati Cancer Institute and Professor, Department of Obstetrics and
Gynecology at the University of Cincinnati. ""New treatment options are
needed to extend the time in between cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy
for these patients, and the results from the NOVA study suggest that
niraparib could represent an important new treatment option for many
patients with ovarian cancer.""
  ""While the identification of mutations in the BRCA genes was a significant
advancement, ovarian cancer remains the deadliest of gynecologic cancers,
and new diagnostic and therapeutic options are needed,"" said David Barley,
Chief Executive Officer of the National Ovarian Cancer Coalition. ""The
results of the NOVA trial are encouraging for patients and their families,
and we look forward to seeing the full results of this study this fall.""
  About the Phase 3 NOVA Clinical Trial of Niraparib
  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that planned to enroll 490 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy.
Patients were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline
BRCA mutation status. One cohort enrolled patients who were germline BRCA
mutation carriers (gBRCAmut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who
were not germline BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut). The non-gBRCAmut
cohort included patients with HRD-positive tumors, including those with
somatic BRCA mutations and other HR defects, and patients with HRD-negative
tumors. Within each cohort, patients were randomized 2:1 to receive
niraparib or placebo and were treated continuously with placebo or 300
milligrams of niraparib, dosed as three 100 milligram tablets once per day,
until progression. The primary endpoint of this study was progression-free
survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints include patient-reported outcomes,
chemotherapy-free interval length, PFS2, overall survival, and other
measures of safety and tolerability.  More information about this trial is
available at http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01847274.
  Niraparib is an investigational agent and, as such, has not been approved by
the U.S. FDA or any other regulatory agencies.
  About Homologous Recombination Deficiency (HRD)
  Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a defect in high-fidelity,
double-strand DNA repair. HRD results from a variety of causes, including
mutations in BRCA and other genes involved in DNA repair, as well as other
unidentified causes.  In cells with HRD, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutant
cells, lack of functional DNA repair pathways, including PARP, leads to
irreparable double-strand breaks, genomic instability, and ultimately cell
death. Because HRD-positive cells are sensitive to DNA-damaging processes,
they are reliant upon proper DNA repair by other pathways, including
PARP-dependent pathways.
  Comprehensive assessment of HRD status includes both tBRCA mutational
analysis and assessment of genomic instability through the combined analysis
of HRD biomarker components LOH, TAI, and LST. myChoiceHRD(R) is a
registered trademark of Myriad Genetics, Inc.
  About Niraparib
  Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being
evaluated in three ongoing pivotal trials. TESARO is building a robust
niraparib franchise by assessing activity across multiple tumor types and by
evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other
therapeutics. The ongoing development program for niraparib includes the
Phase 3 trial in patients with ovarian cancer (the NOVA trial) as described
above; a registrational Phase 2 treatment trial in patients with ovarian
cancer (the QUADRA trial); a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of patients
with BRCA-positive breast cancer (the BRAVO trial); and a Phase 3 trial in
patients with first-line ovarian cancer (the PRIMA trial). Several
collaborator-sponsored studies are also underway, including combination
trials of niraparib plus pembrolizumab and bevacizumab. Janssen Biotech has
licensed rights to develop and commercialize niraparib specifically for
patients with prostate cancer worldwide, except in Japan.
  About Ovarian Cancer
  Approximately 22,000 women are diagnosed each year with ovarian cancer in
the United States, and nearly 80% are diagnosed after the disease has become
symptomatic and has progressed to a late stage. Ovarian cancer is the fifth
most frequent cause of cancer death among women. Despite high response rates
to platinum-based chemotherapy in the second-line advanced treatment
setting, 90% of patients will experience recurrence within two years. If
approved, niraparib may address the difficult ""watchful waiting"" periods
experienced by patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in between cycles of
platinum-based chemotherapy.","TESARO's Niraparib Significantly Improved Progression-Free Survival for Patients With Ovarian Cancer in Both Cohorts of the Phase 3 NOVA Trial    -- The NOVA trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of PFS in the       germline BRCA mutant cohort     -- The NOVA trial successfully achieved its primary endpoint of PFS in the       non-germline BRCA mutant cohort, including both the HRD-positive and       overall analysis populations     -- NOVA is the first successful prospectively designed Phase 3 trial of a       PARP inhibitor     -- NDA and MAA submissions are planned for Q4 2016   WALTHAM, Mass., June 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSRO), an oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the Phase 3 NOVA trial of niraparib successfully achieved its primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS).

CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2016--
  Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company
developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system
disorders, today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2
clinical trial of SAGE-547 for the treatment of severe postpartum depression
(PPD). SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in
the HAM-D score compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). This represented
a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the
SAGE-547 group at the primary endpoint of 60 hours through trial completion
with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically
significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours, (p=0.006) with
an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day
follow-up (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D <=7,
measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group compared
with 1 of 11 in the placebo group (p=0.008). Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10
of the SAGE-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission
(p=0.03). SAGE-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious
adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. A
greater number of adverse events were reported in the placebo arm than in
the treatment arm of the trial. There are no approved therapies specifically
for PPD and therapeutic options in severe PPD are limited.
  ""This is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the
pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date,"" said Samantha
Meltzer-Brody, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor and Director of the UNC
Perinatal Psychiatry Program of the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders
and primary investigator for the PPD-202 Trial. ""The rapid onset of action
of this drug observed in the trial is unlike anything else available in the
field to date. The data show the potential of the drug to provide relief
from the debilitating symptoms of PPD, and to markedly decrease suffering in
women who are severely affected.""
  This was a Phase 2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1
randomization trial that was designed to enroll up to 32 women. The
population studied were women with severe PPD (HAM-D >=26) who developed
severe depression either in the third trimester or within four weeks of
childbirth. At baseline, the mean HAM-D scores for both groups was greater
than 28. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of
SAGE-547 on depression as measured by the HAM-D score, compared to placebo,
at 60 hours. In addition, patients were monitored during a 30-day follow-up
period to assess both safety and efficacy.
  ""These data speak for themselves. The unmet need in the PPD patient
population cannot be overstated. Given the societal impact of this
condition, and the possible identification of a biological basis for
treating these women, we are hopeful these data will point to a new
understanding of this disorder and the development of effective therapies""
said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. ""Further, as the
second positive placebo-controlled trial involving SAGE-547, the first being
in essential tremor, this demonstrates the potential broad utility of our
differentiated GABA mechanism and the candidate molecules in our pipeline,
not only for neurological disorders, but now for mood and affective
disorders as well. I am extremely proud of the great work from the Sage team
and we are thankful to our patients and investigators.""
  ""There has been a long-standing need to find an effective treatment option
for women with postpartum depression, not only to alleviate the suffering of
those women struggling with the disease, but to mitigate the effect on their
family and children. Based on our review of the literature, we believe these
data represent an unprecedented opportunity for developing treatments for
PPD, and believe that our findings will serve as a paradigm shift in how the
disease is thought about and, if our development program is successful, how
PPD might be treated in the future,"" said Steve Kanes, M.D., Ph.D., Chief
Medical Officer of Sage. ""The results of this study replicate and extend the
findings of our original, open-label probe study of PPD reported previously.
Given the consistent activity signals seen in both our open-label and
placebo-controlled trials, we also intend to examine the development
pathways for several of our other proprietary pipeline compounds into the
treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression,
bipolar disorder and panic disorder.""
  Secondary endpoints, including the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating
Scale (MADRS), showed a similar pattern of significant difference (p=0.004)
at 24 hours and maintained to 30 days (p=0.01). MADRS total scores at
baseline were 37.5 and 37.0 for SAGE-547 and placebo groups, respectively.
At 60 hours post-initiation of treatment, the mean change from baseline in
MADRS total score for the SAGE-547 group was -27.9 compared with the placebo
group mean change of -12.2; this treatment difference of 15.7 points was
statistically significant (p=0.01). Presentation of more comprehensive data
from the trial is expected at future medical meetings and in publications.
  The company has initiated an expansion of this Phase 2 clinical program to
determine optimal dosing of SAGE-547 in PPD. This expanded trial involves
dose exploration in moderate as well as severe patients, in a multicenter,
placebo-controlled trial of SAGE-547 with enrollment to begin before the end
of the year. In addition, the company intends to move forward with a PPD
program involving its oral molecule, SAGE-217, and to seek regulatory input
to determine the appropriate pathways for developing both medications for
this indication.
  Summary of Top-line SAGE-547 Phase 2 Study Results
  Effect on Depressive Symptoms
   -- The 21 patients enrolled in the trial were required to have had a Major
      Depressive Episode that began no earlier than the third trimester and no


      later than the first four weeks following delivery, and to also be less
      than six months postpartum at the time of enrollment. Trial participants


      were also required to have a HAM-D score of 26 or above prior to
      treatment.


   -- Patients were randomized one-to-one to either SAGE-547 or placebo, and
      were administered blinded IV inpatient treatment as a continuous
infusion
      for 60 hours. Ten patients were randomized to SAGE-547 treatment, while
      11 patients were randomized to placebo. Patients were allowed to remain
      on background medications that could not be adjusted during treatment.
      Only three patients in each group were on such medications.


   -- The study was designed to titrate dosing based on body weight.
   -- SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint with a significant reduction in
      the HAM-D scale compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008).


   -- SAGE-547 patients experienced a 19.0 point mean reduction in their HAM-D


      scores at 24 hours (p=0.006), achieving a greater than 10.6 point
      difference from placebo at that time point and was maintained at similar


      magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01).


   -- Results from secondary efficacy endpoints, including other rating scales


      such as the MADRS, reinforced the overall efficacy observed with
SAGE-547
      in the trial.


   -- Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D less than or equal
to
      7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 SAGE-547 patients and 1 of
      11 placebo patients (p=0.008). The remission finding in the SAGE-547
      group was maintained out to 30 days (p=0.03), demonstrating a strong
      durability of effect from SAGE-547 for over three weeks following the
end
      of treatment.
  Safety and tolerability:
   -- SAGE-547 was generally well tolerated in this study. There were no
deaths,
      serious adverse events or discontinuations.


   -- Overall, fewer patients who received SAGE-547 experienced adverse events


      compared with placebo: 4 of 10 on SAGE-547 and 8 of 11 on placebo.


   -- Similar number of patients reported Nervous System Disorder Adverse
      Events: 3 of 10 on SAGE-547 and 4 of 11 on placebo.


   -- Equal number of patients reported the cluster of dizziness, sedation or
      somnolence: 3 in each group.


   -- Fewer SAGE-547 patients reported Psychiatric Disorder Adverse Events: 0
      of 10 on SAGE-547 and 5 of 11 on placebo. Adverse events included
      abnormal dreams, insomnia and anxiety for placebo.

  About the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)
","Sage Reports Positive Top-line Results Including Demonstration of 30-Day Durability from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of SAGE-547 in Severe Postpartum Depression   Primary endpoint achieved with statistical significance at 60 hours maintained through 30 days   70% remission achieved at 60 hours of SAGE-547 treatment and maintained at 30-day follow-up   Company expects to pursue further development of SAGE-547 and SAGE-217 for PPD in a global clinical program   Conference call scheduled for 8:00 AM ET today CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 12, 2016--   Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system disorders, today announced positive top-line results from its Phase 2 clinical trial of SAGE-547 for the treatment of severe postpartum depression (PPD). SAGE-547 achieved the primary endpoint of a significant reduction in the HAM-D score compared to placebo at 60 hours (p=0.008). This represented a greater than 20 point mean reduction in the depression scores of the SAGE-547 group at the primary endpoint of 60 hours through trial completion with a greater than 12 point difference from placebo. The statistically significant difference in treatment effect began at 24 hours, (p=0.006) with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through to the 30-day follow-up (p=0.01). Remission from depression, as determined by a HAM-D <=7, measured at 60 hours, was seen in 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group compared with 1 of 11 in the placebo group (p=0.008). Similarly, at 30 days, 7 of 10 of the SAGE-547 group and 2 of 11 in the placebo group were in remission (p=0.03). SAGE-547 was found to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported during the treatment and follow-up periods. A greater number of adverse events were reported in the placebo arm than in the treatment arm of the trial. There are no approved therapies specifically for PPD and therapeutic options in severe PPD are limited.   ""This is potentially one of the most important clinical findings in the pharmacologic treatment of postpartum depression to date,"" said Samantha Meltzer-Brody, M.D., M.P.H., Associate Professor and Director of the UNC Perinatal Psychiatry Program of the UNC Center for Women's Mood Disorders and primary investigator for the PPD-202 Trial. ""The rapid onset of action of this drug observed in the trial is unlike anything else available in the field to date. The data show the potential of the drug to provide relief from the debilitating symptoms of PPD, and to markedly decrease suffering in women who are severely affected.""   This was a Phase 2, multi-center, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 1:1 randomization trial that was designed to enroll up to 32 women. The population studied were women with severe PPD (HAM-D >=26) who developed severe depression either in the third trimester or within four weeks of childbirth. At baseline, the mean HAM-D scores for both groups was greater than 28. The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the effect of SAGE-547 on depression as measured by the HAM-D score, compared to placebo, at 60 hours. In addition, patients were monitored during a 30-day follow-up period to assess both safety and efficacy.   ""These data speak for themselves. The unmet need in the PPD patient population cannot be overstated. Given the societal impact of this condition, and the possible identification of a biological basis for treating these women, we are hopeful these data will point to a new understanding of this disorder and the development of effective therapies"" said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. ""Further, as the second positive placebo-controlled trial involving SAGE-547, the first being in essential tremor, this demonstrates the potential broad utility of our differentiated GABA mechanism and the candidate molecules in our pipeline, not only for neurological disorders, but now for mood and affective disorders as well. I am extremely proud of the great work from the Sage team and we are thankful to our patients and investigators.""   ""There has been a long-standing need to find an effective treatment option for women with postpartum depression, not only to alleviate the suffering of those women struggling with the disease, but to mitigate the effect on their family and children. Based on our review of the literature, we believe these data represent an unprecedented opportunity for developing treatments for PPD, and believe that our findings will serve as a paradigm shift in how the disease is thought about and, if our development program is successful, how PPD might be treated in the future,"" said Steve Kanes, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer of Sage. ""The results of this study replicate and extend the findings of our original, open-label probe study of PPD reported previously. Given the consistent activity signals seen in both our open-label and placebo-controlled trials, we also intend to examine the development pathways for several of our other proprietary pipeline compounds into the treatment of a variety of psychiatric disorders, such as major depression, bipolar disorder and panic disorder.""   Secondary endpoints, including the Montgomery--&#197;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), showed a similar pattern of significant difference (p=0.004) at 24 hours and maintained to 30 days (p=0.01). MADRS total scores at baseline were 37.5 and 37.0 for SAGE-547 and placebo groups, respectively. At 60 hours post-initiation of treatment, the mean change from baseline in MADRS total score for the SAGE-547 group was -27.9 compared with the placebo group mean change of -12.2; this treatment difference of 15.7 points was statistically significant (p=0.01).

PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 05, 2016--
  Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) announced today that CheckMate -026,
a trial investigating the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not
meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with
previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose
tumors expressed PD-L1 at >= 5%. The company will complete a full evaluation
of the CheckMate -026 data and work with investigators on the future
presentation of the results.
  Giovanni Caforio, M.D., chief executive officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb,
commented, ""Opdivo has become a foundational treatment that is transforming
cancer care across multiple tumor types. While we are disappointed CheckMate
-026 did not meet its primary endpoint in this broad patient population, we
remain committed to improving patient outcomes through our comprehensive
development program, including the ongoing Phase 3 CheckMate -227 study
exploring the potential of the combination of Opdivo plus Yervoy for PD-L1
positive patients, and Opdivo plus Yervoy, or Opdivo plus chemotherapy in
PD-L1 negative patients.""
  About CheckMate -026
  CheckMate -026 is a Phase 3, open-label, randomized study of Opdivo as
monotherapy versus investigator's choice chemotherapy in patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients enrolled in the trial
had received no prior systemic treatment for advanced disease and tested
positive for PD-L1 expression. The trial randomized 541 patients to receive
either Opdivo 3 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks or investigator's choice
chemotherapy in squamous patients (gemcitabine with cisplatin/gemcitabine
with carboplatin/paclitaxel with carboplatin) and non-squamous patients
(pemetrexed with cisplatin/pemetrexed with carboplatin) until disease
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or completion of 6 cycles. The primary
endpoint is progression-free survival, as assessed by the Independent
Radiology Review Committee, in patients with >= 5% PD-L1 tumor expression.
  Bristol-Myers Squibb & Immuno-Oncology: Advancing Oncology Research
  At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we have a vision for the future of cancer care that
is focused on Immuno-Oncology, now considered a major treatment choice
alongside surgery, radiation, chemotherapy and targeted therapies for
certain types of cancer.
  We have a comprehensive clinical portfolio of investigational and approved
Immuno-Oncology agents, many of which were discovered and developed by our
scientists. Our ongoing Immuno-Oncology clinical program is looking at broad
patient populations, across multiple solid tumors and hematologic
malignancies, and lines of therapy and histologies, with the intent of
powering our trials for overall survival and other important measures like
durability of response. We pioneered the research leading to the first
regulatory approval for the combination of two Immuno-Oncology agents, and
continue to study the role of combinations in cancer.
  We are also investigating other immune system pathways in the treatment of
cancer including CTLA-4, CD-137, KIR, SLAMF7, PD-1, GITR, CSF1R, IDO and
LAG-3. These pathways may lead to potential new treatment options -- in
combination or monotherapy -- to help patients fight different types of
cancers.
  Our collaboration with academia, as well as small and large biotech
companies, to research the potential Immuno-Oncology and non-Immuno-Oncology
combinations, helps achieve our goal of providing new treatment options in
clinical practice.
  At Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are committed to changing survival expectations
in hard-to-treat cancers and the way patients live with cancer.
  About Opdivo
  Cancer cells may exploit ""regulatory"" pathways, such as checkpoint pathways,
to hide from the immune system and shield the tumor from immune attack.
Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the checkpoint
receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T-cells, and blocks the binding of
PD-L1 and PD-L2, preventing the PD-1 pathway's suppressive signaling on the
immune system, including the interference with an anti-tumor immune
response.
  Opdivo's broad global development program is based on Bristol-Myers Squibb's
understanding of the biology behind Immuno-Oncology. Our company is at the
forefront of researching the potential of Immuno-Oncology to extend survival
in hard-to-treat cancers. This scientific expertise serves as the basis for
the Opdivo development program, which includes a broad range of Phase 3
clinical trials evaluating overall survival as the primary endpoint across a
variety of tumor types. The Opdivo trials have also contributed toward the
clinical and scientific understanding of the role of biomarkers and how
patients may benefit from Opdivo across the continuum of PD-L1 expression.
To date, the Opdivo clinical development program has enrolled more than
18,000 patients.
  Opdivo was the first PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to receive regulatory
approval anywhere in the world in July 2014, and currently has regulatory
approval in 54 countries including the United States, Japan and in the
European Union.

  IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
  WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS
  YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.
These immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the
most common severe immune- mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis,
hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy,
and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions
initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to
months after discontinuation of YERVOY.
  Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis,
neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including
liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and
thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.
  Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose
corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.
  Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis
  Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO
treatment. Across the clinical trial experience with solid tumors, fatal
immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred with OPDIVO. In addition, in CheckMate
069, there were six patients who died without resolution of abnormal
respiratory findings. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging
and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or
greater pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold
until resolution for Grade 2. In CheckMate 069 and 067, immune-mediated
pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients receiving OPDIVO with
YERVOY: Fatal (n=1), Grade 3 (n=6), Grade 2 (n=17), and Grade 1 (n=1). In
CheckMate 037, 066, and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.8%
(14/787) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=2) and Grade 2 (n=12). In
CheckMate 057, immune- mediated pneumonitis, including interstitial lung
disease, occurred in 3.4% (10/287) of patients: Grade 3 (n=5), Grade 2
(n=2), and Grade 1 (n=3). In CheckMate 025, pneumonitis, including
interstitial lung disease, occurred in 5% (21/406) of patients receiving
OPDIVO and 18% (73/397) of patients receiving everolimus. Immune-mediated
pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (18/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 4
(n=1), Grade 3 (n=4), Grade 2 (n=12), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 205
and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9%
(13/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred
in 3.4% (9/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2
(n=8).","Bristol-Myers Squibb Announces Top-Line Results from CheckMate -026, a Phase 3 Study of Opdivo (nivolumab) in Treatment-Na&#239;ve Patients with Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer   Opdivo did not meet trial primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients expressing PD-L1 >= 5% PRINCETON, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 05, 2016--   Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) announced today that CheckMate -026, a trial investigating the use of Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy, did not meet its primary endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors expressed PD-L1 at >= 5%.

Please refer to the end of the Important Safety Information for a brief description of the patient populations studied in the CheckMate trials.   IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION   WARNING: IMMUNE-MEDIATED ADVERSE REACTIONS   YERVOY can result in severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions. These immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system; however, the most common severe immune- mediated adverse reactions are enterocolitis, hepatitis, dermatitis (including toxic epidermal necrolysis), neuropathy, and endocrinopathy. The majority of these immune-mediated reactions initially manifested during treatment; however, a minority occurred weeks to months after discontinuation of YERVOY.   Assess patients for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy, and endocrinopathy and evaluate clinical chemistries including liver function tests (LFTs), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level, and thyroid function tests at baseline and before each dose.   Permanently discontinue YERVOY and initiate systemic high-dose corticosteroid therapy for severe immune-mediated reactions.   Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis   Immune-mediated pneumonitis, including fatal cases, occurred with OPDIVO treatment. Across the clinical trial experience with solid tumors, fatal immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred with OPDIVO. In addition, in CheckMate 069, there were six patients who died without resolution of abnormal respiratory findings. Monitor patients for signs with radiographic imaging and symptoms of pneumonitis. Administer corticosteroids for Grade 2 or greater pneumonitis. Permanently discontinue for Grade 3 or 4 and withhold until resolution for Grade 2. In CheckMate 069 and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 6% (25/407) of patients receiving OPDIVO with YERVOY: Fatal (n=1), Grade 3 (n=6), Grade 2 (n=17), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 037, 066, and 067, immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 1.8% (14/787) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=2) and Grade 2 (n=12). In CheckMate 057, immune- mediated pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 3.4% (10/287) of patients: Grade 3 (n=5), Grade 2 (n=2), and Grade 1 (n=3). In CheckMate 025, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 5% (21/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO and 18% (73/397) of patients receiving everolimus. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 4.4% (18/406) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 4 (n=1), Grade 3 (n=4), Grade 2 (n=12), and Grade 1 (n=1). In CheckMate 205 and 039, pneumonitis, including interstitial lung disease, occurred in 4.9% (13/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (9/263) of patients receiving OPDIVO: Grade 3 (n=1) and Grade 2 (n=8).",,-18%

statistical significance in primary efficacy endpoint
  Preliminary safety findings show sparsentan was generally safe and
well-tolerated
  Conference call scheduled for today at 8:30 a.m. ET
  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Retrophin, Inc. (NASDAQ:RTRX)
today announced positive top-line results from the Phase 2 DUET study of
sparsentan for the treatment of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a
rare kidney disorder without an approved pharmacologic treatment that often
leads to end-stage renal disease. The study achieved statistical
significance in the primary efficacy endpoint for the overall sparsentan
treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction of
proteinuria compared to irbesartan after the eight-week, double-blind
treatment period.
  ""We are very pleased with the robust top-line results from DUET, which
suggest sparsentan could be a significant advancement in the treatment of
FSGS,"" said Stephen Aselage, chief executive officer of Retrophin. ""FSGS
patients today face poor outcomes with limited medical options; we look
forward to working with the FDA to find the most expeditious path forward
that would deliver the first approved pharmacologic treatment to the FSGS
community.""
  In the DUET study, the mean reduction of proteinuria from baseline after
eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 200, 400, and 800
mg/day of sparsentan (n=64) was 44.8 percent, compared to a mean reduction
of proteinuria for all patients receiving 300 mg/day of irbesartan (n=32) of
18.5 percent (p=0.006). Further, the mean reduction of proteinuria from
baseline after eight weeks of treatment for all patients treated with 400 mg
and 800 mg doses of sparsentan (n=51) was 47.4 percent, compared to a mean
proteinuria reduction of 19.0 percent for patients receiving 300 mg of
irbesartan (n=25) in these two dose cohorts (p=0.011). The comparison of
individual sparsentan dose cohorts to irbesartan showed clear signals of
relative improvement, but did not reach statistical significance.
  ""The results from DUET serve as proof of concept for sparsentan's novel
approach of combining endothelin receptor type A blockade with angiotensin
II inhibition for the treatment of FSGS,"" said Alvin Shih, M.D., executive
vice president and head of research & development for Retrophin.
""Significant reductions in proteinuria, along with a well-tolerated
preliminary safety profile have us excited about being one step closer to
providing a new treatment option for patients with FSGS.""
  Top-line results suggest sparsentan was generally safe and well-tolerated in
the DUET study. One serious adverse event, anemia, classified as potentially
related to treatment occurred in the sparsentan group but did not result in
study discontinuation during the eight-week blinded treatment period. There
were no withdrawals due to fluid retention during the eight-week blinded
treatment period. All patients who completed the eight-week treatment period
entered the ongoing open label extension study, and the vast majority of
these patients continue to receive therapy.
  The Company plans to present detailed study results, including data from the
open label extension, at an upcoming medical meeting or in a peer-reviewed
publication.

  About the DUET Study
  The DUET study is an international, randomized, double-blind, Phase 2
clinical trial assessing the safety and efficacy of sparsentan in 109
patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), of which 96
qualified for the evaluable database. The primary endpoint is the reduction
of proteinuria, as compared to irbesartan, which is part of a class of drugs
used to manage FSGS in the absence of an approved pharmacologic treatment.
After a two-week washout period, patients were randomized to receive daily
oral doses of 200 mg, 400 mg, and 800 mg of sparsentan or 300 mg of
irbesartan. After completing the eight-week treatment period, all patients
were eligible to receive sparsentan as part of the study's open-label
extension.
  About Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS)
  Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, is a rare disorder without an
approved pharmacologic treatment option that is estimated to affect up to
40,000 patients in the U.S. with similar prevalence in Europe. The disorder
is defined by progressive scarring of the kidney and often leads to
end-stage renal disease. FSGS is characterized by proteinuria, where protein
is found in the urine due to a breakdown of the normal filtration mechanism
in the kidney. Other common symptoms include swelling in parts of the body
known as edema, as well as low blood albumin levels, abnormal lipid
profiles, and hypertension.
  Reduction in proteinuria is widely regarded to be beneficial in the
treatment of FSGS, and may be associated with a decreased risk of
progression to end-stage renal disease. In the absence of an approved
pharmacologic treatment, FSGS patients are currently managed with
angiotensin receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,
calcineurin inhibitors, and steroids.
  About Sparsentan
  Sparsentan could be the first approved pharmacologic treatment for focal
segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, a rare kidney disorder that often
leads to end-stage renal disease. Sparsentan's dual mechanism of action
combines angiotensin receptor blockade with endothelin receptor type A
blockade. In several forms of chronic kidney disease, endothelin receptor
blockade has been shown to have an additive beneficial effect on proteinuria
in combination with renin-angiotensin blockade via angiotensin receptor
blockade or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.
  The Phase 2 DUET study of sparsentan met the primary efficacy endpoint for
the overall treatment group, demonstrating a greater than two-fold reduction
of proteinuria compared to irbesartan, after the eight-week, double-blind
treatment period. The Company plans to engage the FDA to determine the most
expeditious path forward to advance the development of sparsentan towards
approval. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European
Commission each granted sparsentan orphan drug designation for the treatment
of FSGS.

  First Successful Phase 3 Trial of an Oral Anti-diabetic for Type 1 Diabetes
  Conference call and webcast September 9, 2016 at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time
  PR Newswire
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Sept. 9, 2016
  THE WOODLANDS, Texas, Sept. 9, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Lexicon Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (Nasdaq: LXRX) announced today that the pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3
clinical trial of sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint, showing a
statistically significant reduction in A1C at 24 weeks in patients with type
1 diabetes on a background of optimized insulin.
  Top-line results from the Phase 3 study showed that patients treated with
sotagliflozin had a mean A1C reduction from baseline of 0.43% on 200mg once
daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) and a reduction of 0.49% on 400mg once
daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on
placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study's primary endpoint.
This statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in A1C
for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe
hypoglycemia, one of the most prevalent serious health challenges in type 1
diabetes, which was seen less frequently in both treatment arms than
placebo.
  ""We are extremely pleased with these top-line results and the potential
long-term benefits that sotagliflozin may bring to people with type 1
diabetes,"" said Lexicon President and Chief Executive Officer Lonnel Coats.
""We believe these results provide evidence that sotagliflozin, with its
novel dual inhibition of both SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, is particularly well suited
to help these individuals achieve better A1C levels without increasing and
possibly reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.""
  ""Our companies are working together to develop this compound for the
treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes,"" said Jorge Insuasty, Senior Vice
President, Head of Global Development, Sanofi.  ""These top-line results
highlight potential benefits of sotagliflozin when treating adults with type
1 diabetes.  We congratulate our partners on this positive outcome and look
forward to further exploring this compound for the treatment of adults with
type 2 diabetes when Sanofi begins the Phase 3 program later this year.""
  ""The inTandem1 study is part of the largest Phase 3 program for an oral
anti-diabetic agent in type 1 diabetes to date,"" said Anne Peters, M.D.,
Professor of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Director of the
USC Clinical Diabetes Programs and Chairman of the Sotagliflozin Type 1
Diabetes Steering Committee.  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated compelling,
significant and clinically meaningful A1C reduction with no increase in
severe hypoglycemia and a slight risk of DKA.  If approved, sotagliflozin
could represent a significant addition to the current standard of care and
potentially allow patients with type 1 diabetes to better manage their
diabetes while on insulin.""
  About inTandem1
  The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 study known as inTandem1
enrolled 793 patients in the United States and Canada with type 1 diabetes
on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level
entering the study between 7.0% and 11.0%, which corresponds to an estimated
average blood sugar of 154 mg/dl to 269 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l to 15.0 mmol/l).
The three-arm study evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin, 200mg and 400mg,
each taken once daily before the first meal of the day, against placebo.
Prior to randomization, insulin was optimized for all patients over a
six-week period, with the objective of improving glycemic control using
insulin alone.  After completion of this optimization period, patients were
maintained on optimized insulin and randomized to one of two doses of
sotagliflozin or placebo, and their baseline, post-optimization A1C was
measured.  The mean baseline A1C level at the time of randomization after
the six-week optimization period was 7.6% for all three dose arms.
  The primary endpoint of the study was change in A1C from baseline after a
24-week period of treatment.  The trial has a double-blind long term
extension of 28-weeks, with a total treatment duration of 52-weeks. There
were 268 patients in the placebo arm, 263 patients in the 200mg dose arm and
262 patients in the 400mg dose arm.  The overall mean placebo adjusted A1C
reduction was 0.35% in the 200mg dose arm (p<0.001) and 0.41% in the 400mg
dose arm (p<0.001).
  Sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated.  Across all three dose arms
(placebo, 200mg, 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events
(AEs) were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious
AEs (SAEs) were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and discontinuation due
to AEs were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. There were no reported deaths
in the study.
  Two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe
hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The number of patients with
severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18
(6.7%), 11 (4.2%), and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms,
respectively.  The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week
treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%), and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg
and 400mg dose arms, respectively.
  Lexicon is conducting another similar pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial
predominantly in Europe (inTandem2), which is expected to report top-line
results by the end of the year.  The third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical
trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400
patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a
background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to
randomization. Sanofi is expected to commence Phase 3 clinical trials for
sotagliflozin in patients with type 2 diabetes by the end of the year.
  About Sotagliflozin
  Discovered using Lexicon's unique approach to gene science, sotagliflozin is
a first-in-class, oral dual inhibitor of two proteins responsible for
glucose regulation known as sodium-glucose co-transporter types 1 and 2
(SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT1 is responsible for glucose absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract, and SGLT2 is responsible for glucose reabsorption by
the kidney. Sotagliflozin has been shown in a Phase 2 study to improve
glycemic control in people with type 1 diabetes while reducing their need
for mealtime insulin.
  Lexicon entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi in
November 2015 under which Lexicon granted Sanofi an exclusive, worldwide,
royalty-bearing right and license to develop, manufacture and commercialize
sotagliflozin.  Lexicon is responsible for all clinical development
activities relating to type 1 diabetes and retains an exclusive option to
co-promote and have a significant role, in collaboration with Sanofi, in the
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes in
the United States.  Sanofi is responsible for all clinical development and
commercialization of sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
worldwide and is solely responsible for the commercialization of
sotagliflozin for the treatment of type 1 diabetes outside the United
States.

(Nasdaq: LXRX) announced today that the pivotal inTandem1 Phase 3 clinical trial of sotagliflozin met its primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant reduction in A1C at 24 weeks in patients with type 1 diabetes on a background of optimized insulin.   Top-line results from the Phase 3 study showed that patients treated with sotagliflozin had a mean A1C reduction from baseline of 0.43% on 200mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) and a reduction of 0.49% on 400mg once daily sotagliflozin dose (p<0.001) as compared to a reduction of 0.08% on placebo after 24 weeks of treatment, meeting the study's primary endpoint. This statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in A1C for both doses of sotagliflozin was achieved without an increase in severe hypoglycemia, one of the most prevalent serious health challenges in type 1 diabetes, which was seen less frequently in both treatment arms than placebo.   ""We are extremely pleased with these top-line results and the potential long-term benefits that sotagliflozin may bring to people with type 1 diabetes,"" said Lexicon President and Chief Executive Officer Lonnel Coats. ""We believe these results provide evidence that sotagliflozin, with its novel dual inhibition of both SGLT-1 and SGLT-2, is particularly well suited to help these individuals achieve better A1C levels without increasing and possibly reducing the risk of severe hypoglycemia.""   ""Our companies are working together to develop this compound for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes,"" said Jorge Insuasty, Senior Vice President, Head of Global Development, Sanofi.  ""These top-line results highlight potential benefits of sotagliflozin when treating adults with type 1 diabetes.  We congratulate our partners on this positive outcome and look forward to further exploring this compound for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes when Sanofi begins the Phase 3 program later this year.""   ""The inTandem1 study is part of the largest Phase 3 program for an oral anti-diabetic agent in type 1 diabetes to date,"" said Anne Peters, M.D., Professor of Medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC, Director of the USC Clinical Diabetes Programs and Chairman of the Sotagliflozin Type 1 Diabetes Steering Committee.  ""Sotagliflozin demonstrated compelling, significant and clinically meaningful A1C reduction with no increase in severe hypoglycemia and a slight risk of DKA.  If approved, sotagliflozin could represent a significant addition to the current standard of care and potentially allow patients with type 1 diabetes to better manage their diabetes while on insulin.""   About inTandem1   The double-blind, placebo controlled, Phase 3 study known as inTandem1 enrolled 793 patients in the United States and Canada with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump or multiple daily injection therapy who had an A1C level entering the study between 7.0% and 11.0%, which corresponds to an estimated average blood sugar of 154 mg/dl to 269 mg/dl (8.6 mmol/l to 15.0 mmol/l). The three-arm study evaluated two doses of sotagliflozin, 200mg and 400mg, each taken once daily before the first meal of the day, against placebo. Prior to randomization, insulin was optimized for all patients over a six-week period, with the objective of improving glycemic control using insulin alone.  After completion of this optimization period, patients were maintained on optimized insulin and randomized to one of two doses of sotagliflozin or placebo, and their baseline, post-optimization A1C was measured.  The mean baseline A1C level at the time of randomization after the six-week optimization period was 7.6% for all three dose arms.   The primary endpoint of the study was change in A1C from baseline after a 24-week period of treatment.  The trial has a double-blind long term extension of 28-weeks, with a total treatment duration of 52-weeks. There were 268 patients in the placebo arm, 263 patients in the 200mg dose arm and 262 patients in the 400mg dose arm.  The overall mean placebo adjusted A1C reduction was 0.35% in the 200mg dose arm (p<0.001) and 0.41% in the 400mg dose arm (p<0.001).   Sotagliflozin was generally well tolerated.  Across all three dose arms (placebo, 200mg, 400mg), the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) were 67.5%, 67.3% and 71.0%, respectively; the incidence of serious AEs (SAEs) were 3.4%, 3.8% and 6.9%, respectively; and discontinuation due to AEs were 1.5%, 1.1% and 3.8%, respectively. There were no reported deaths in the study.   Two primary safety concerns for patients with type 1 diabetes are severe hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The number of patients with severe hypoglycemic events during the 24-week treatment period was 18 (6.7%), 11 (4.2%), and 12 (4.6%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.  The number of patients with DKA events during the 24-week treatment period was 0 (0.0%), 3 (1.1%), and 8 (3.1%) in the placebo, 200mg and 400mg dose arms, respectively.   Lexicon is conducting another similar pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial predominantly in Europe (inTandem2), which is expected to report top-line results by the end of the year.  The third type 1 diabetes Phase 3 clinical trial, inTandem3, is underway globally and is studying approximately 1,400 patients treated with sotagliflozin 400mg once daily or placebo on a background of any insulin therapy, but without insulin optimization prior to randomization.

RoclatanTM Successfully Achieves Primary Efficacy Endpoint in Mercury 1 Study

Conference Call and Webcast Today, September 14, at 5:00 p.m. ET

Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:AERI), a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of first-in-class therapies for the treatment of glaucoma and other diseases of the eye, today reported the successful 90-day primary efficacy results of its 12-month Phase 3 “Mercury 1” clinical trial for its fixed-dose combination product candidate, RoclatanTM. The study achieved its primary efficacy endpoint demonstrating statistical superiority over each of its components, including Aerie product candidate RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, and market leading prostaglandin analogue (PGA) latanoprost, all of which were dosed once daily in the evening. The study evaluated patients with maximum baseline intraocular pressures (IOPs) ranging from above 20 to below 36 mmHg (millimeters of mercury). The IOP-lowering effect of RoclatanTM was 1 to 3 mmHg greater than monotherapy with either latanoprost or RhopressaTM throughout the duration of the study. Management will host a conference call with accompanying slides to discuss these results at 5:00 p.m. ET today. The accompanying slides are available at Aerie’s web site, aeriepharma.com.

RoclatanTM Phase 3 Highlights for Mercury 1

RoclatanTM dosed once daily achieved the primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating statistical superiority over both latanoprost and RhopressaTM at the primary endpoint range of baseline IOPs from above 20 to below 36 mmHg for each of the nine measured time points.
IOPs were measured at 8 a.m., 10 a.m., and 4 p.m. at week 2, week 6, and day 90. RoclatanTM IOP lowering exceeded that of latanoprost in a range of 1.3 to 2.5 mmHg, and exceeded RhopressaTM IOP lowering in a range of 1.8 to 3.0 mmHg. Efficacy levels were consistent across the 90-day period for all arms in the study.
RoclatanTM mean diurnal IOP-lowering exceeded that of latanoprost by an average across the study duration of 1.9 mmHg and exceeded RhopressaTM by 2.6 mmHg.
RoclatanTM reduced mean diurnal IOPs to 16 mmHg or lower in 61 percent of patients, a significantly higher percentage than observed in the comparator arms.
The most common RoclatanTM adverse event was hyperemia, or eye redness, which was reported in approximately 50 percent of patients, or 30 percent above baseline, and was scored as mild for the large majority of these patients. There were no drug-related serious adverse events for any of the comparators in the trial.
Aerie will hold an “Investor Day” in New York City on October 5, 2016 to cover further details from the Mercury 1 trial and to provide a general business update.
“We are very pleased by these RoclatanTM 90-day efficacy results from the Mercury 1 clinical trial. As expected, the topline efficacy demonstrated in this trial clearly reconfirms the potential for RoclatanTM to become the most efficacious IOP-lowering therapy to enter the market, if approved. If Mercury 1 and 2 are successful, we expect to file the NDA for RoclatanTM near year-end 2017,” said Vicente Anido, Jr., Ph.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Aerie.

Dr. Anido continued, “We also noted that the RhopressaTM arm demonstrated high levels of efficacy across the full range of baseline IOPs studied, and the efficacy was maintained for the 90-day period. Importantly, RhopressaTM demonstrated comparable levels of IOP lowering to latanoprost at baseline IOPs ranging from 20 to 25 mmHg in Mercury 1. This performance for RhopressaTM is consistent with levels observed in the previous Phase 2b trials for RhopressaTM and RoclatanTM.”

Richard A. Lewis, M.D., Aerie’s Chief Medical Officer added, “Once-daily RoclatanTM has shown a degree of IOP lowering in Mercury 1 that is quite impressive, especially when considering its ability to bring patient pressures down to levels as low as 8 to 14 mmHg. The safety profile of RoclatanTM observed thus far in Mercury 1 points to a safe and tolerable product.”

About RoclatanTM

RoclatanTM is a once-daily eye drop that combines RhopressaTM, as described below, with latanoprost, a PGA that is the most widely prescribed glaucoma drug in the world. Based on our preclinical studies and clinical trials, we believe that RoclatanTM, if approved, would be the first glaucoma product to lower IOP through all known mechanisms: (i) increasing fluid outflow through the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary drain, (ii) increasing fluid outflow through the uveoscleral pathway, the eye’s secondary drain, (iii) reducing fluid production in the eye, and (iv) reducing episcleral venous pressure (EVP). By covering the full spectrum of known IOP-lowering mechanisms, RoclatanTM has the potential to provide a greater IOP-lowering effect than any currently approved glaucoma product.

The first Phase 3 registration trial for RoclatanTM, named Mercury 1 is a 12-month safety trial in 718 patients with a 90-day efficacy readout, which is the subject of this press release. The topline efficacy readout demonstrated that RoclatanTM was statistically superior to each of its components. The second Phase 3 registration trial, named Mercury 2, is a 90-day efficacy trial that commenced in March 2016, and a third Phase 3 registration trial, named Mercury 3, is expected to commence in Europe in the first half of 2017. Mercury 3 is not necessary for approval in the U.S., but rather to facilitate regulatory approval and commercialization in Europe.

About RhopressaTM

RhopressaTM (netarsudil ophthalmic solution) 0.02%, is a novel eye drop that we believe, if approved, would become the only once-daily product available that, based on Aerie’s preclinical studies, specifically targets the trabecular meshwork, the eye’s primary fluid drain and the diseased tissue responsible for elevated IOP in glaucoma. Preclinical studies have also demonstrated that RhopressaTM lowers episcleral venous pressure, which contributes approximately half of IOP in healthy subjects. Further, based on Aerie’s preclinical studies, RhopressaTM provides an additional mechanism that reduces fluid production in the eye and therefore lowers IOP. Biochemically, RhopressaTM has been shown in Aerie studies to inhibit both Rho Kinase (ROCK) and norepinephrine transporter (NET). Recent preclinical studies have also shown that RhopressaTM may have disease-modifying properties, including an anti-fibrotic effect on the trabecular meshwork and the potential to increase perfusion of the trabecular meshwork. Preclinical research is also currently underway to evaluate the potential neuroprotective benefits of RhopressaTM.

The results of two Phase 3 registration trials (Rocket 2 and Rocket 1) for RhopressaTM were included in a NDA filing submitted to the FDA in the third quarter of 2016. Rocket 2 represents the pivotal trial, and Rocket 1 is supportive. There are two additional Phase 3 trials currently underway for RhopressaTM, named Rocket 3 and Rocket 4. Rocket 3 is a 12-month safety-only study in Canada that is not needed for the NDA filing. Rocket 4 is designed to provide adequate six-month safety data for regulatory filing purposes in Europe, and is also not needed for the NDA filing.

  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2016
  SAN DIEGO, Sept. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Mast Therapeutics, Inc. (NYSE MKT:
MSTX), a biopharmaceutical company developing novel, clinical-stage
therapies for sickle cell disease and heart failure, today reported top-line
results from EPIC, a Phase 3 clinical study of its investigational new drug
vepoloxamer (also known as MST-188) for the treatment of individuals with
sickle cell disease experiencing vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC).  The study did
not meet its primary efficacy endpoint of demonstrating a statistically
significant reduction in the mean duration of VOC (82 hours in the
vepoloxamer group compared to 78 hours in the placebo group in the
intent-to-treat population (p=0.09)).  There were no statistically
significant differences between treatment groups in the intent-to-treat
population across the two secondary efficacy endpoints, rate of
re-hospitalization for VOC and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome.
Consistent with previously conducted studies, vepoloxamer was generally well
tolerated with no statistically significant differences in treatment-related
serious adverse events in the vepoloxamer group compared to the placebo
group. No deaths occurred on the study.
  ""We are exceedingly disappointed with these top-line results. While clearly
not the outcome we wanted, we believe the insights and data from the largest
placebo-controlled clinical trial ever completed in sickle cell disease will
substantially advance the understanding of vaso-occlusive crisis and the
still maturing clinical science necessary to support the development of new
therapeutics for this debilitating disease,"" stated Brian M. Culley, the
Company's Chief Executive Officer. ""We wish to reiterate our sincere
appreciation for all of the patients, caregivers, and others who aided us in
conducting this informative study.""
  ""These analyses are limited to just top-line data, so in the coming weeks
the Company intends to review the full data set from EPIC. In addition, we
plan to perform an interim analysis of the ongoing heart failure trial of
vepoloxamer. However, based on the data we've seen to date, we expect we
will terminate all clinical development of vepoloxamer. Consequently, while
we evaluate our options, we intend to significantly and immediately reduce
our operating expenses and continue our efforts with AIR001, our lead asset
in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, which currently is the
subject of a 100-patient phase 2 study expected to complete enrollment by
the end of 2017,"" continued Mr. Culley.

  About the EPIC Study
  The EPIC study was a randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled,
Phase 3 clinical trial of vepoloxamer in individuals with sickle cell
disease hospitalized for acute pain typical of vaso-occlusive crisis who
required treatment with parenteral opioid analgesia. The primary objective
of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of vepoloxamer in reducing the
duration of vaso-occlusive crisis, with the duration of crisis measured from
the time of randomization to the time at which the patient received the last
dose of parenteral opioid analgesia for the treatment of vaso-occlusive
crisis prior to hospital discharge.  Vepoloxamer or placebo (0.45% saline)
was administered intravenously as a 1 hour loading dose infusion (100
mg/kg), immediately followed by a continuous maintenance infusion (30
mg/kg/hr) for at least 12 hours and up to 48 hours.  Randomization was
stratified by age (>=4 to <16 years or >=16 to <=65 years), use of
hydroxyurea (yes or no), and pain score (measured using the Wong-Baker
FACES(R) Pain Rating Scale at time of randomization: <8 or >=8). The study
was 90% powered to detect a 17% (16-hour) difference in treatment arms, with
a statistical significance level of p=0.05 (assuming an average crisis
duration of 96 hours in the control arm and a coefficient of variation >
50%).  Secondary efficacy endpoints were to compare the rates of
re-hospitalization for vaso-occlusive crisis within 14 days of initial
hospital discharge and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within 120
hours of randomization between the treatment and control groups.
  A total of 388 patients, ages four to 46, were randomized in EPIC.  More
than 75 study sites in 14 countries participated.  The average age was 15
years.  Patients under age 18 accounted for approximately 71% of total
subjects.  Approximately 61% of patients were concurrently on hydroxyurea
therapy.
  About Sickle Cell Disease and Vaso-Occlusive Crisis
  Sickle cell disease is a chronic, genetic blood disorder that affects
millions worldwide and an estimated 100,000 people in the United States,
where it is classified as a rare, or orphan, disease.  The hallmark of
sickle cell disease is vaso-occlusive crisis, which results from obstruction
of blood vessels by sickled red blood cells causing tissue ischemia and
injury.  Vaso-occlusions can occur everywhere blood flows and lead to an
accumulating disease burden in every organ system with the ultimate loss of
vital organ function and significantly reduced lifespan.  Vaso-occlusive
crisis is also characterized by intense and debilitating pain which can last
for days and even weeks.  There are between 80,000 to 100,000
hospitalizations annually in the U.S. related to vaso-occlusive crisis and
no FDA approved treatment to shorten its duration or reduce the risk of
ischemic injury related to crisis.

  Company Plans to Present Additional Data at Upcoming Scientific Meeting
SANTA MONICA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 26, 2016--
  Kite Pharma, Inc., (Nasdaq:KITE) today announced positive topline results
from a pre-planned interim analysis of ZUMA-1 for its lead product
candidate, KTE-C19, in patients with chemorefractory diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma (DLBCL). KTE-C19 met the primary endpoint of objective response
rate (ORR), p<0.0001, with ORR of 76 percent, including 47 percent complete
remissions (CR).
  ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL into two
cohorts. Cohort 1 included patients with DLBCL, and Cohort 2 enrolled
patients with transformed follicular lymphoma (TFL) and primary mediastinal
B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Kite's intent is to seek regulatory approval of
KTE-C19 in DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL based upon the combined data of both
cohorts.
  The interim analysis of ZUMA-1 evaluated the ORR in the first 51 patients in
Cohort 1 with at least three months of follow-up. This analysis also
included an additional 11 patients in Cohort 2. The table below summarizes
the response rates from this interim analysis together with the previously
reported results from the Phase 1 portion of ZUMA-1 (Neelapu ASCO 2016).

  Across the combined 62 patients, the most common grade 3 or higher adverse
events included neutropenia (66 percent), anemia (40 percent), febrile
neutropenia (29 percent), thrombocytopenia (29 percent), and encephalopathy
(26 percent). Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and
neurological toxicity was observed in 18 percent and 34 percent of patients,
respectively. Two patients died from KTE-C19 related adverse events
(hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest in the setting of
CRS).
  The Phase 2 interim outcomes in ZUMA-1 are largely consistent with results
from the Phase 1 portion of the study and the National Cancer Institute
(NCI) study based on the same CAR construct, a low-dose
cyclophosphamide-fludaribine conditioning regimen, and Kite's proprietary
manufacturing process (Kochenderfer ASCO 2016).
  ""ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL, a disease
that is very difficult to treat. The combined CR rate of 39 percent at three
months is very exciting as it represents nearly a five-fold increase from
the CR rate of 8 percent seen in the SCHOLAR-1 study in a similar patient
population,"" said Jeff Wiezorek, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical
Development. ""ZUMA-1 is the largest CAR-T study reported in NHL. We were
able to manufacture KTE-C19 for 99 percent of patients enrolled in the
study, and successfully handle the study logistics and adverse event
management at over 20 sites, most of which had no prior experience in CAR-T
therapy.""
  Additional data from this interim analysis will be submitted for
presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. The primary analysis of 101
patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL (DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL) will
include approximately six months of follow-up and is expected in the first
quarter of 2017.
  ""We are grateful to the study participants and investigators who have made
this important research possible. What started at the NCI over a decade ago
with the pioneering work of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., has evolved
into a technology that has the potential to fundamentally change the outlook
of patients with cancer. For patients with aggressive NHL, every day matters
and a new treatment option like KTE-C19 is desperately needed,"" said Arie
Belldegrun, M.D., FACS, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Kite. ""I am proud of what we have achieved to date and excited to apply our
advanced learnings from ZUMA-1 to our ongoing clinical development programs
to bring continued innovation to patients and the scientific community at
large.""
  ZUMA-1 is supported in part by funding from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society
(LLS) Therapy Acceleration Program(R) .

Grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurological toxicity was observed in 18 percent and 34 percent of patients, respectively. Two patients died from KTE-C19 related adverse events (hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cardiac arrest in the setting of CRS).   The Phase 2 interim outcomes in ZUMA-1 are largely consistent with results from the Phase 1 portion of the study and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) study based on the same CAR construct, a low-dose cyclophosphamide-fludaribine conditioning regimen, and Kite's proprietary manufacturing process (Kochenderfer ASCO 2016).   ""ZUMA-1 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL, a disease that is very difficult to treat. The combined CR rate of 39 percent at three months is very exciting as it represents nearly a five-fold increase from the CR rate of 8 percent seen in the SCHOLAR-1 study in a similar patient population,"" said Jeff Wiezorek, M.D., Senior Vice President of Clinical Development. ""ZUMA-1 is the largest CAR-T study reported in NHL. We were able to manufacture KTE-C19 for 99 percent of patients enrolled in the study, and successfully handle the study logistics and adverse event management at over 20 sites, most of which had no prior experience in CAR-T therapy.""   Additional data from this interim analysis will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific meeting. The primary analysis of 101 patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL (DLBCL, TFL and PMBCL) will include approximately six months of follow-up and is expected in the first quarter of 2017.   ""We are grateful to the study participants and investigators who have made this important research possible. What started at the NCI over a decade ago with the pioneering work of Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., has evolved into a technology that has the potential to fundamentally change the outlook of patients with cancer. For patients with aggressive NHL, every day matters and a new treatment option like KTE-C19 is desperately needed,"" said Arie Belldegrun, M.D., FACS, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Kite. ""I am proud of what we have achieved to date and excited to apply our advanced learnings from ZUMA-1 to our ongoing clinical development programs to bring continued innovation to patients and the scientific community at large.""   ZUMA-1 is supported in part by funding from The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society (LLS) Therapy Acceleration Program(R) .

  LONDON, Sept. 26, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GW Pharmaceuticals plc
(Nasdaq:GWPH) (AIM:GWP) (""GW,"" ""the Company"" or ""the Group""), a
biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and
commercializing novel therapeutics from its proprietary cannabinoid product
platform, announces positive results of the second randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of its investigational medicine
Epidiolex(R) (cannabidiol or CBD) for the treatment of seizures associated
with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a rare and severe form of
childhood-onset epilepsy. In this trial, Epidiolex, when added to the
patient's current treatment, achieved the primary endpoint for both dose
levels with high statistical significance. During the treatment period,
patients taking Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly
drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in
patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients taking Epidiolex
10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 37
percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo
(p=0.0016).
  This trial follows the announcement in June 2016 of positive results in the
first pivotal Phase 3 trial of Epidiolex for the treatment of seizures
associated with LGS, and the March 2016 announcement of positive results in
the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome.  GW expects to
submit a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration
(FDA) in the first half of 2017.
  ""The positive outcome in this second trial of Epidiolex in patients with
Lennox-Gastaut syndrome demonstrates the effectiveness of this product in
this particularly difficult to treat, childhood-onset epilepsy,"" stated
Orrin Devinsky, M.D., of New York University Langone Medical Center's
Comprehensive Epilepsy Center and principal investigator in the trial. ""The
data from the Epidiolex Dravet and LGS studies offers the prospect of an
FDA-approved CBD medicine that shows both clinically meaningful seizure
reduction and a consistent safety and tolerability profile. I believe
Epidiolex has the potential to become an important new option within the
field of treatment-resistant epilepsy.""
  ""Today brings great news for the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome community,"" said
Christina SanInocencio, Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
Foundation. ""The announcement of a second set of positive results with
Epidiolex is exciting as they offer much needed hope for patients and their
families living with this debilitating condition where new treatment options
are desperately needed.""
  ""The Epilepsy Foundation is thrilled to learn about the recent preliminary
results for an innovative new therapy from GW for LGS. LGS in so many cases
is extremely difficult to treat, and is an incredible challenge for children
and families. We feel a tremendous sense of urgency to stop seizures, and
believe that the pursuit of new therapies offers hope to individuals who
have no currently available therapy to effectively stop their seizures. The
Epilepsy Foundation will continue to be a champion for GW's efforts to
pursue this innovative new therapy as studies progress. We thank GW and all
our partners who invest in a better tomorrow for people with epilepsy,""
stated Philip Gattone, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Epilepsy
Foundation.
  ""We are very pleased to report this second positive Phase 3 trial in
seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. This is the third positive
Phase 3 trial for Epidiolex reported in 2016. All three trials provide GW
with robust evidence to support the efficacy and safety of Epidiolex. This
latest trial also shows that Epidiolex likely has an effective dose range,
allowing for dose flexibility to address individual patient needs. These
compelling results make us more determined than ever to make this important
new medicine available to patients who suffer from these treatment-resistant
childhood-onset epilepsies,"" stated Justin Gover, GW's Chief Executive
Officer.
  Trial Overview and Result
  Patients aged 2-55 years with a confirmed diagnosis of drug-resistant LGS
currently uncontrolled on one or more concomitant anti-epileptic drugs
(AEDs) were eligible to participate in this Phase 3, randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The trial randomized 225 patients
into three arms, where Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day (n=76), Epidiolex 10mg/kg/day
(n=73) or placebo (n=76) was added to current AED treatment. On average,
patients were taking approximately three AEDs, having previously tried and
discontinued an average of seven other AEDs. The average age of trial
participants was 16 years (30 percent were 18 years or older). The median
drop seizure frequency over the 4 week baseline period was 85.
  The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was a comparison between
Epidiolex and placebo in the percentage change in the monthly frequency of
drop seizures during the 14 week treatment period (two week dose escalation
period followed by 12 weeks of maintenance) compared to the 4 week baseline
period before randomization. Drop seizures were defined as atonic, tonic or
tonic-clonic seizures involving the entire body, trunk or head that led or
could have led to a fall, injury, slumping in a chair or hitting the
patient's head on a surface.
  During the treatment period, patients taking Epidiolex 20mg/kg/day achieved
a median reduction in monthly drop seizures of 42 percent compared with a
reduction of 17 percent in patients taking placebo (p=0.0047), and patients
taking Epidiolex 10mg/kg/day achieved a median reduction in monthly drop
seizures of 37 percent compared with a reduction of 17 percent in patients
taking placebo (p=0.0016).
  A series of sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint for both dose
groups confirmed the robustness of these results. In both dose groups, the
difference between Epidiolex and placebo emerged during the first month of
treatment and was sustained during the entire treatment period. Results from
secondary efficacy endpoints in both dose groups reinforced the overall
effectiveness observed with Epidiolex.
  Epidiolex was generally well tolerated in this trial.  The pattern of
adverse events was consistent with that reported in the previous two Phase 3
studies. One patient on 10mg/kg Epidiolex discontinued treatment due to an
adverse event compared with six patients on 20mg/kg and one patient on
placebo.
  Of the 84 percent of 10mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 89
percent of them deemed it to be mild or moderate.  Of the 94 percent of
20mg/kg patients who experienced an adverse event, 88 percent of them
reported it to be mild or moderate. 72 percent of patients on placebo
experienced an adverse event.
  The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than 10 percent of
Epidiolex-treated patients) in the 10mg/kg group were: somnolence, decreased
appetite, upper respiratory infection, diarrhea, and status epilepticus.
None of the cases of status epilepticus in the 10mg/kg group was deemed
treatment-related. The most common adverse events (occurring in greater than
10 percent of Epidiolex-treated patients) in the 20mg/kg group were:
somnolence, decreased appetite, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection,
pyrexia, vomiting, and nasopharyngitis.
  Thirteen patients on Epidiolex 10mg/kg experienced a serious adverse event
(two of which were deemed treatment-related) compared with thirteen patients
on 20mg/kg (five of which were deemed treatment-related) and eight patients
on placebo (none of which were deemed treatment-related).
  There were no deaths in this trial.
  Of the patients who completed this trial, 99 percent have opted to continue
into an open-label extension trial.
  Further data will be presented in future publications and medical meetings.
  Epidiolex New Drug Application (NDA)
  Following the success of the first Dravet syndrome Phase 3 trial earlier
this year, GW requested a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA to discuss a proposed
Dravet syndrome NDA. This meeting took place in July 2016 and also included
some discussion of data from the first Phase 3 LGS trial. As a result of
this constructive meeting, GW believes the guidance received enables the
Company's proposed filing strategy to submit a single NDA that includes
Phase 3 data from one Dravet trial and two LGS trials,  and which remains on
track for a submission in the first half of 2017. Subject to satisfactory
review, GW now anticipates a simultaneous decision on both indications and
does not expect to wait for results from the second trial in Dravet syndrome
prior to this submission.
  In order to support GW's NDA, the Company expects to provide the FDA with
data from ten Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, as well as safety data in over
1,800 patients from both the expanded access program and pivotal programs,
including over 450 patients with one year or more of Epidiolex continuous
exposure. This data is in addition to the pivotal efficacy data.
  Epidiolex has Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of LGS,
Dravet syndrome, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Infantile Spasms.

Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq: INCY) today announced that the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) has published an abstract (#1110PD) containing updated data from the Phase 1 portion of the ECHO-202 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of epacadostat, Incyte’s selective IDO1 enzyme inhibitor, in combination with Keytruda® (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy. These data will be highlighted in a poster discussion on Monday, 10 October 2016 from 11:00-12:00 CET at the ESMO Annual Congress 2016 in Copenhagen, Denmark.

In patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma (n=19), updated data show a disease control rate (DCR) of 74 percent and an overall response rate (ORR) of 58 percent. All responses are confirmed and ongoing (median follow-up 42 weeks); median progression-free survival (PFS) has not been reached.

“We are very pleased that after extended treatment and longer follow-up, these updated Phase 1 data for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab demonstrate robust, durable clinical activity in patients with treatment-naïve advanced melanoma and reinforce the promise of IDO1 inhibition in combination with an anti-PD-1 therapy as an important component of immunotherapy,” said Steven Stein, M.D., Incyte’s Chief Medical Officer.

Epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab was well-tolerated. The most common (≥15%) all grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were fatigue, rash, arthralgia, pruritus, diarrhea and nausea. Grade ≥3 TRAEs were observed in 18% of patients; the most common were rash (8%) and increased lipase (3%).

The ECHO-202 abstract was made available today on the ESMO Congress website at http://esmo.org/Conferences/ESMO-2016-Congress.

The ECHO-202 poster is expected to be made available to attendees at the ESMO Congress on Friday, 7 October 2016, at which time the ECHO-202 poster will be made available via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com. Incyte will also host an investor conference call and webcast at 14:00 CET (8:00 a.m. ET) on 7 October 2016 which can be accessed via the Events and Presentations tab of the Investor section of www.incyte.com.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) is a key immunosuppressive enzyme that modulates the anti-tumor immune response by promoting regulatory T cell generation and blocking effector T cell activation, thereby facilitating tumor growth by allowing cancer cells to avoid immune surveillance. Epacadostat is a first-in-class, highly potent and selective oral inhibitor of the IDO1 enzyme that reverses tumor-associated immune suppression and restores effective anti-tumor immune responses. In single-arm studies, the combination of epacadostat and immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown proof-of-concept in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. In these studies, epacadostat combined with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab or the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab improved response rates compared with studies of the immune checkpoint inhibitors alone.

  VANCOUVER, British Columbia and DOYLESTOWN, Pa., Sept. 29, 2016 (GLOBE
NEWSWIRE) -- Arbutus Biopharma Corporation (Nasdaq:ABUS), an
industry-leading hepatitis B virus (HBV) therapeutic solutions company,
today reported interim results from the first two cohorts of the ongoing
ARB-1467 Phase II multi-dose clinical trial in chronically infected HBV
patients.  The first two cohorts enrolled patients with hepatitis B
e-antigen (HBeAg) negative chronic HBV infection. At this time, serum HBsAg
data are available following single doses for both Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 and
following multiple doses for Cohort 1.
  Single dose ARB-1467 results for Cohorts 1 and 2 demonstrate significant
reductions in serum HBsAg levels. Importantly, multiple dose results from
Cohort 1 show a step-wise, additive reduction in serum HBsAg. These multiple
dose results are the first of their kind for an RNAi product candidate in
patients with chronic HBV infection. Treatment with ARB-1467 has been
generally well tolerated to date.

very important finding because it suggests that even greater reductions in
serum HBsAg levels may be observed with continued dosing of ARB-1467,"" said
Dr. Douglas T. Dieterich, Professor of Medicine in the Division of Liver
Disease at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center. ""These
exciting data demonstrate the antiviral effect of ARB-1467 and the potential
to include this agent as a component of a combination therapy regimen for
the treatment of chronic HBV infection.""
  ""We are excited about these HBV efficacy data from our ongoing ARB-1467
Phase II trial demonstrating substantial reductions in serum HBsAg, which is
an important first step towards one day curing chronic HBV infection. We
believe that further study of ARB-1467 will help determine the optimal
protocol to produce maximal reductions in serum HBsAg,"" said Dr. Mark J.
Murray, Arbutus' President and CEO. ""We plan to release additional
multi-dose data later this year. We believe that ultimately curing HBV will
require combination therapy and we are developing a portfolio of HBV assets
with complementary mechanisms of action to accomplish this goal.""
  ARB-1467 Phase 2 Trial Design
  The Phase II trial is a multi-dose study in chronic HBV patients who are
also receiving stable nucleot(s)ide analog therapy. The trial consists of
three cohorts, each enrolling eight subjects; six receiving three monthly
doses of ARB-1467, and two receiving placebo. The first two cohorts include
HBeAg- patients, followed by a third cohort in HBeAg+ patients.
  About ARB-1467
  Arbutus' RNAi candidate ARB-1467 comprises three RNAi triggers that target
all four HBV transcripts, and has been shown in preclinical studies to
reduce all viral antigen levels as well as cccDNA and HBV DNA.  ARB-1467
utilizes Arbutus' proprietary lipid nanoparticle (LNP) platform, a
clinically validated delivery technology which has been tested in hundreds
of patients.

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Genocea Biosciences,
Inc. (NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed
vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive results from its
ongoing Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003
for the treatment of genital herpes. The study achieved its primary
endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction
of 40 percent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug
of Matrix-M2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. The viral
shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at
the same time point in a prior Phase 2 trial.
  ""We are very encouraged by this positive data and have now selected a dose
of 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 of GEN-003 for our planned Phase 3
trials. This is the third consecutive trial in which GEN-003 has
demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral activity
immediately post-dosing. In the previous Phase 2 trial, success in this
measure translated into a significant impact on genital herpes clinical
disease, durable to at least 12 months,"" said Chip Clark, president and
chief executive officer of Genocea. ""This body of data supports our strong
belief that GEN-003 could be a cornerstone treatment for genital herpes. We
look forward to reporting six-month placebo-controlled clinical data from
this trial in January 2017 and expect to commence our Phase 3 program in the
second half of 2017.""
  During the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing,

  ""The established clinical profile of GEN-003 is one that could be highly
beneficial to patients looking for an effective treatment which potentially
offers greatly improved convenience over daily oral antivirals, the only
current treatment option for the millions of people suffering from genital
herpes,"" said Lori A. Panther, M.D., MPH, Infectious Diseases specialist at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Assistant Professor of Medicine at
Harvard Medical School.  ""I'm extremely encouraged by these results, once
again demonstrating that GEN-003 reduces viral shedding. Control of viral
shedding is fundamental to the control of genital herpes outbreaks and the
epidemic spread of the disease.""
  About the GEN-003 Phase 2b Clinical Trial
  This Phase 2b trial is the first study testing potential Phase 3 endpoints
with an improved formulation of GEN-003 - manufactured with
commercially-scalable processes - which will be used in future Phase 3
trials. The trial enrolled 131 subjects from 9 institutions in the United
States. Subjects have been randomized to one of three dose groups - placebo,
60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 and 60 ug per protein / 75 ug of
Matrix M2 - and have received three injections at 21-day intervals. Viral
shedding rate reductions were measured to demonstrate the efficacy of the
new formulation. The study will also compare GEN-003 efficacy to placebo for
the clinical endpoints of: the proportion of patients who are lesion free at
six and 12 months after dosing; the time to first lesion recurrence after
dosing; and, the impact on percentage of days with genital herpes lesions at
six and 12 months after dosing. All subjects will be followed for 12 months
after the last dose.

  About GEN-003
  Inducing a T cell response against genital herpes is critical to treating
the clinical symptoms of disease and controlling transmission of the
infection. GEN-003 is a first-in-class T cell directed immunotherapy
designed to elicit both a T cell and B cell (antibody) immune response. The
immunotherapy was designed using Genocea's ATLAS(TM) platform, which
profiles the comprehensive spectrum of actual T cell responses mounted by
humans in response to disease, to identify antigen targets that drive T cell
response. GEN-003 includes the antigens ICP4 and gD2 along with
Matrix-M2(TM)  adjuvant, which Genocea licenses from Novavax, Inc. For more

  About Genital Herpes
  Genital Herpes affects more than 400 million people worldwide and causes
recurrent, painful genital lesions. It can be transmitted to sexual
partners, even when the disease is asymptomatic. Current genital herpes
therapies only partially control clinical symptoms and viral shedding, a
process which drives disease transmission. Incomplete control of genital
lesions and transmission risk, expense and the perceived inconvenience of
taking a daily medication are hurdles for long-term disease management.
Immunity through T cells is believed to be particularly critical to the
control and possible prevention of genital herpes infections.
  About Genocea
  Genocea is harnessing the power of T cell immunity to develop life-changing
vaccines and immunotherapies. T cells are increasingly recognized as a
critical element of protective immune responses to a wide range of diseases,
but traditional discovery methods have proven unable to identify the targets
of such protective immune response. Using ATLAS, its proprietary technology
platform, Genocea identifies these targets to potentially enable the rapid
development of medicines to address critical patient needs. Genocea's
pipeline of novel clinical stage T cell-enabled product candidates includes
GEN-003 for genital herpes, GEN-004 for the prevention of infection by all
serotypes of pneumococcus (development suspended pending further data
analysis and consultation with our advisers), and earlier-stage programs in
cancer immunotherapy, chlamydia, genital herpes prophylaxis and malaria .

(NASDAQ:GNCA), a biopharmaceutical company developing T cell-directed vaccines and immunotherapies, today announced positive results from its ongoing Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003 for the treatment of genital herpes. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant reduction of 40 percent in the rate of viral shedding in the 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 dose group compared to both baseline and placebo. The viral shedding rate reduction for this dose was consistent with its performance at the same time point in a prior Phase 2 trial.   ""We are very encouraged by this positive data and have now selected a dose of 60 ug per protein / 50 ug of Matrix-M2 of GEN-003 for our planned Phase 3 trials. This is the third consecutive trial in which GEN-003 has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral activity immediately post-dosing. In the previous Phase 2 trial, success in this measure translated into a significant impact on genital herpes clinical disease, durable to at least 12 months,"" said Chip Clark, president and chief executive officer of Genocea. ""This body of data supports our strong belief that GEN-003 could be a cornerstone treatment for genital herpes. We look forward to reporting six-month placebo-controlled clinical data from this trial in January 2017 and expect to commence our Phase 3 program in the second half of 2017.""

  PR Newswire
  TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2016
  TARRYTOWN, N.Y., Sept. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals,
Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) today announced topline results from the Phase 2 CAPELLA
study evaluating aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab, an
anti-platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (anti-PDGFR-beta)
antibody, in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (wet
AMD). The combination therapy did not demonstrate an improvement in best
corrected visual acuity (BCVA) compared to intravitreal aflibercept
injection monotherapy at 12 weeks, the primary endpoint of the study. At 12
weeks, patients in both combination aflibercept/rinucumab groups showed a
5.8 letter improvement in BCVA. Patients treated with aflibercept alone
showed a 7.5 letter improvement in BCVA.
  ""EYLEA(R) (aflibercept) injection is an established, effective therapy that
has set a high bar in the treatment of wet AMD,"" said George D. Yancopoulos
M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Regeneron and President of
Regeneron Laboratories. ""The addition of rinucumab did not improve on the
efficacy of aflibercept alone. We are committed to continuing to innovate
for patients with serious vision-threatening diseases, and look forward to
the results of our ongoing combination studies of aflibercept and
nesvacumab, an anti-angiopoietin 2 antibody, for which the preclinical data
is more supportive.""
  EYLEA results in this study were consistent with the efficacy and safety
seen in Phase 3 pivotal studies in wet AMD. The efficacy results in the
CAPELLA trial were consistent across all choroidal neovascularization (CNV)
subtypes. Adding rinucumab to aflibercept showed no benefit on anatomic
endpoints including reduction in retinal thickness or in resolution of
subretinal hyper-reflective material. Ocular adverse events at 12 weeks were
more common in the combination treatment groups (23.5 and 20 percent)
compared to aflibercept alone (16 percent), primarily driven by an increase
in conjunctival hemorrhage, eye irritation and eye pain.
  The ongoing Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, controlled, multiple-dose,
regimen-ranging study has enrolled approximately 500 patients with wet AMD.
Efficacy was evaluated using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Scale
(ETDRS) BCVA. Patients were randomized into one of three groups and received
fixed doses every four weeks of either aflibercept monotherapy 2mg,
aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 1mg or aflibercept 2mg/rinucumab 3mg. The
co-formulation was administered as a single intravitreal injection. At week
12, two of the three treatment groups were re-randomized, resulting in five
total dosing groups in the second phase of the study. Data will be evaluated
at 28 weeks and again at 52 weeks, when the study is completed.
  More detailed results will be submitted for presentation at a future medical
congress.

  -- Company to Host Conference Call Today at 5:00 p.m. ET --
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--October 05, 2016--
  Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics
company, announced today that upon the recommendation of the ENDEAVOUR Phase
3 study Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to suspend dosing, the Company has
decided to discontinue development of revusiran, an investigational RNA
interference (RNAi) therapeutic that was being developed for the treatment
of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis with cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM). This decision
was made yesterday evening and has been communicated to investigators, study
sites, and regulatory authorities.
  Following recent reports in the Phase 2 OLE study of new onset or worsening
peripheral neuropathy, the ENDEAVOUR DMC assembled yesterday at the
Company's request to review these reports and ENDEAVOUR data on an unblinded
basis. The DMC did not find conclusive evidence for a drug-related
neuropathy signal in the ENDEAVOUR trial, but informed the Company that the
benefit-risk profile for revusiran no longer supported continued dosing. The
Company subsequently reviewed unblinded ENDEAVOUR data which revealed an
imbalance of mortality in the revusiran arm as compared to placebo.
  ""Patient safety comes first. We have stopped all dosing and are actively
monitoring patients across revusiran studies to ensure their safety. We will
also continue to evaluate ENDEAVOUR data to understand the potential cause
of these findings,"" said John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer at
Alnylam. ""While this outcome is disappointing given the lack of available
treatment options for patients suffering from this devastating disease, we
remain committed to serving the needs of the ATTR amyloidosis community. We
would like to thank patients, caregivers, investigators, and study staff who
have been so supportive of the revusiran program.""
  The decision to discontinue development of revusiran does not affect
patisiran, which is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of
hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN), or any other Alnylam
investigational RNAi therapeutic program in development.
  Based on a current assessment of the safety data across the Company's other
programs, which include the ALN-PCSsc program partnered with The Medicines
Company, there is no evidence of a drug-related neuropathy signal in over
800 treated subjects and patients with exposure of up to 34 months. This
includes patisiran, which utilizes a lipid nanoparticle delivery
formulation, and the seven other clinical programs in Alnylam's pipeline,
which all use Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC) GalNAc delivery
technology. ESC-GalNAc conjugates enable dose and exposure levels that are
12-30 times lower than revusiran, which uses Standard Template Chemistry
(STC) GalNAc delivery technology. The Company reaffirms its ""Alnylam 2020""
guidance and remains committed to the advancement of these investigational
RNAi therapeutics for treatment of diseases with high unmet medical need.
  If there are any questions regarding this announcement, please call the
Clinical Trial Information Line at 866-330-0326 (toll-free within the U.S.)
or 617-575-7400 (International). Alternatively, you may email any questions

  About ATTR Amyloidosis
  ATTR amyloidosis is a progressively debilitating and often fatal disease
caused by deposition of transthyretin (TTR) in peripheral tissues. TTR
protein is produced primarily in the liver and is normally a carrier of
vitamin A. In hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (hATTR), mutations in TTR cause
abnormal amyloid proteins to accumulate and damage body organs and tissue,
such as the peripheral nerves and heart, resulting in intractable peripheral
sensory neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, and/or cardiomyopathy. Hereditary
ATTR amyloidosis represents a major unmet medical need with significant
morbidity and mortality; hATTR amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (hATTR-PN) --
also known as familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) -- affects
approximately 10,000 people worldwide and hATTR amyloidosis with
cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) -- also known as familial amyloidotic
cardiomyopathy (FAC) -- is estimated to affect at least 40,000 people
worldwide. hATTR-PN patients have a life expectancy of 5 to 15 years from
symptom onset, and the only approved treatment options for early stage
disease are liver transplantation and tafamidis (approved in Europe, certain
countries in Latin America and Japan, where it is approved for all stages of
disease). hATTR-CM is fatal within 2.5 to 5 years of diagnosis and treatment
is currently limited to supportive care. Wild-type ATTR amyloidosis (wtATTR)
-- previously called senile systemic amyloidosis (SSA) -- is a
non-hereditary form of TTR cardiac amyloidosis caused by idiopathic
deposition of wild-type TTR; its prevalence is generally unknown, but is
associated with advanced age. There is a significant need for novel
therapeutics to treat patients with ATTR amyloidosis.
  Sanofi Genzyme Alliance
  In January 2014, Alnylam and Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global
business unit of Sanofi, formed an alliance to accelerate and expand the
development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics across the world. The
alliance is structured as a multi-product geographic alliance in the field
of rare diseases. Alnylam retains product rights in North America and
Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme obtained the right to access certain
programs in Alnylam's current and future Genetic Medicines pipeline in the
rest of the world (ROW) through the end of 2019, together with certain
broader co-development/co-commercialization rights and global rights for
certain products. In the case of patisiran, Alnylam will advance the product
in North America and Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme will advance the
product in the ROW.
  About GalNAc Conjugates and Enhanced Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc
Conjugates
  GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a proprietary Alnylam delivery platform and are
designed to achieve targeted delivery of RNAi therapeutics to hepatocytes
through uptake by the asialoglycoprotein receptor. Alnylam's Enhanced
Stabilization Chemistry (ESC)-GalNAc-conjugate technology enables
subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability, and a wide
therapeutic index. This delivery platform is being employed in nearly all of
Alnylam's pipeline programs, including programs in clinical development.
  About RNAi
  RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a
breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells, and
a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its discovery
has been heralded as ""a major scientific breakthrough that happens once
every decade or so,"" and represents one of the most promising and rapidly
advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery today which was awarded
the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. RNAi is a natural process
of gene silencing that occurs in organisms ranging from plants to mammals.
By harnessing the natural biological process of RNAi occurring in our cells,
the creation of a major new class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics,
is on the horizon. Small interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate
RNAi and comprise Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of
diseases by potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing
disease-causing proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the
potential to treat disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.
  About LNP Technology
  Alnylam has licenses to Arbutus Biopharma LNP intellectual property for use
in RNAi therapeutic products using LNP technology.
  About Alnylam Pharmaceuticals
  Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based
on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the translation of RNAi
as a new class of innovative medicines. Alnylam's pipeline of
investigational RNAi therapeutics is focused in 3 Strategic Therapeutic
Areas (STArs): Genetic Medicines, with a broad pipeline of RNAi therapeutics
for the treatment of rare diseases; Cardio-Metabolic Disease, with a
pipeline of RNAi therapeutics toward genetically validated, liver-expressed
disease targets for unmet needs in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases;
and Hepatic Infectious Disease, with a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics that
address the major global health challenges of hepatic infectious diseases.
In early 2015, Alnylam launched its ""Alnylam 2020"" guidance for the
advancement and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics as a whole new class
of innovative medicines. Specifically, by the end of 2020, Alnylam expects
to achieve a company profile with 3 marketed products, 10 RNAi therapeutic
clinical programs -- including 4 in late stages of development -- across its
3 STArs. The company's demonstrated commitment to RNAi therapeutics has
enabled it to form major alliances with leading companies including Ionis,
Novartis, Roche, Takeda, Merck, Monsanto, The Medicines Company, and Sanofi
Genzyme. In addition, Alnylam holds an equity position in Regulus
Therapeutics Inc., a company focused on discovery, development, and
commercialization of microRNA therapeutics. Alnylam scientists and

Patients with Candida Infections
  Well-Tolerated and Active Oral Dose of SCY-078 Identified for Invasive
Candidiasis Patients
  Evidence of Efficacy and Lower Relapse Rates versus Standard of Care in VVC
Patients
  Strong Cash Position to Accelerate and Expand Development of SCY-078 in
Multiple Indications
  JERSEY CITY, N.J., Oct. 05, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drug development
company SCYNEXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq:SCYX) today announced the complete results of
its two recently completed Phase 2 studies as well as the closing of a $15
million term loan with Solar Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq:SLRC).
  In the first study, treatment with oral SCY-078 in patients with
vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), resulted in significantly better clinical
cure rates and fewer recurrences of VVC at the four-month follow-up when
compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). In the second study,
which evaluated oral SCY-078 as a step down therapy in patients with
invasive candidiasis, oral SCY-078 achieved the target exposure for efficacy
and was well-tolerated.
  ""We are delighted with these positive results that support the concept that
a fungicidal product with high tissue penetration like SCY-078 could yield
superior clinical outcomes,"" said David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer
of SCYNEXIS.  ""We identified a well-tolerated oral dose that achieves our
target exposure in invasive candidiasis patients, and further confirmed the
antifungal activity of oral SCY-078 in two independent human models of
Candida infections.  These results support our planned development of
SCY-078 as the first drug in a novel antifungal class for the treatment of a
broad range of fungal infections with growing unmet medical needs.""
  Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with VVC
  The first study evaluated the effect of two dose regimens of SCY-078 in
patients with moderate to severe VVC as a proof-of-concept study to support
the development of SCY-078 in invasive candidiasis and other Candida
infections. Clinical cure rate, defined as a resolution of signs and
symptoms of infection without further antifungal treatment, is now the
recommended primary endpoint per the latest FDA guidelines for VVC. As
previously reported, clinical cure rate was higher for patients receiving
oral SCY-078 compared to oral fluconazole at the test of cure visit (Day
24).  Additionally, follow-up data now available showed a high clinical cure
rate at the four-month visit (end of observation period) of 88% in patients
who received SCY-078 compared to 65% in patients who received fluconazole
(p=0.04). Moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who
received SCY-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%).
  Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis
  The second study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and
tolerability of SCY-078 as an oral step-down treatment in patients initially
treated with intravenous (IV) echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida
infections.  Twenty-two patients were randomized to receive study drug or
standard of care (one of the patients randomized to standard of care could
not receive oral fluconazole due to a Candida glabrata with decreased
fluconazole-susceptibility and received micafungin for the entire duration
of antifungal therapy). As previously reported, the study met its primary
objective by confirming the once daily oral dose of SCY-078 750mg as a dose
that is both overall safe and tolerated and achieves the target exposure in
these patients. During the study period, there were no reports of
mycological failures in the SCY-078 750mg group (n=7) versus two
infection-related failures (one fungemia and one abdominal sepsis) in the
fluconazole group (n=7).  No relapses were observed in these two groups
during the six-week follow-up period.
  As previously reported, SCY-078 was overall safe and tolerated in both
studies. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) and no
related serious AEs. Consistent with previous findings, the most common AEs
were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) events such as diarrhea nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort. In patients with invasive
candidiasis, the number of GI events were comparable in both the SCY-078 and
fluconazole treatment arms.
  ""We achieved our stated goals and further de-risked the development of our
lead product candidate, SCY-078,"" said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and
Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. ""With these positive Phase 2 data in
hand, we believe SCY-078 is now the most advanced novel agent in a new
antifungal class that can address the growing issue of resistance. We are
also pleased to announce the infusion of additional funds from Solar
Capital, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to
accelerate and expand the development of SCY-078 and to leverage our
internal antifungal platform.""
  Additional Capital Raised
  SCYNEXIS closed a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital, fully funded at
close.  This transaction complements the company's recent equity raise, and
results in minimal dilution to shareholders.  Please refer to the Form 8-K
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional
information about the facility.
  ""Solar Capital is pleased to start a financing partnership with SCYNEXIS
that should enable the company to expand its pipeline of indications for
SCY-078, as well as accelerate its other development programs,"" said Anthony
Storino, head of life science lending at Solar Capital. ""We believe SCYNEXIS
offers a unique value proposition in an area with significant unmet medical
needs, and we are excited to contribute to the company's growth and future
successes.""
  As of September 30, 2016, SCYNEXIS' preliminary estimate of its cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities totaled $58.4 million, including the
$15 million from the loan facility.
  Armentum Partners acted as financial advisor to SCYNEXIS on the loan
facility.

oral fluconazole in adult female patients with acute vulvovaginal
candidiasis (VVC). A total of 96 patients with an acute moderate to severe,
symptomatic episode of VVC were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
either three daily doses or five daily doses of oral SCY-078 750mg QD with a
1,250mg loading dose or oral fluconazole, at the labeled approved dose
regimen of 150mg single dose. This was a pilot investigation and not powered
to demonstrate a statistical significant difference in the parameters tested
(p values for the comparisons mentioned were >0.05 unless otherwise
indicated). Efficacy was evaluated based on the proportion of patients
achieving clinical cure, mycological eradication and therapeutic cure
(combination of both clinical cure and mycological eradication) at day 24
(+/-3) after initiation of treatment. The 3-day and the 5-day SCY-078
regimens performed similarly, allowing a pooled analysis.  Intent-to-treat
(ITT) population is defined as all subjects randomized (n=96 subjects).
Per-Protocol (PP) population is defined as subjects with culture confirmed
Candida infection at baseline (n=70 subjects).  Subjects in the PP
population were followed for four months. Recurrence was defined as a
symptomatic VVC episode requiring additional antifungal therapy, per
investigators' decision.
  Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis
  Multicenter, multinational, randomized, open-label study (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT02244606) following three to ten days of IV echinocandin
therapy. A total of 27 patients with invasive candidiasis were enrolled and
22 were randomized to receive either SCY-078 500mg QD with a 1,000mg loading
dose (7 patients), SCY-078 750mg QD with a 1,250mg loading dose (7 patients)
or standard of care (7 patients receiving fluconazole 400mg QD with a 800mg
loading dose and 1 patient receiving micafungin IV 100mg QD due to a Candida
glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility for up to 28 days).
Efficacy was assessed based on achievement of favorable global response
defined as the resolution of signs and symptoms attributable to the Candida
infection and mycological eradication without the use of any other
antifungal agent.  Patients were followed for six weeks after the end of
treatment.
  About SCY-078
  SCY-078 is an oral and IV glucan synthase inhibitor in Phase 2 clinical
development for the treatment for fungal infections caused by Candida and
Aspergillus species. SCY-078 is a semi-synthetic triterpene derivative of
the natural product enfumafungin--a structurally distinct class of glucan
synthase inhibitor. SCY-078 combines the well-established activity of glucan
synthase inhibitors (similar to echinocandins) with the flexibility of
having intravenous (IV) and oral formulations (similar to azoles). By
belonging to a chemical class distinct from other antifungals, SCY-078 has
shown in vitro and in vivo activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens,
including azole and echinocandin resistant strains. Positive results from
two recently reported Phase 2 studies provided evidence of the antifungal
activity of orally administered SCY-078 in patients with Candida infections.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track, Qualified
Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) and orphan drug designations (ODD) for the
oral and IV formulations of SCY-078 for the indications of invasive Candida
infections (including candidemia) and invasive Aspergillus infections.
  About Invasive Candidiasis
","SCYNEXIS Announces Complete Results from Two Phase 2 Studies of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Candida spp. Infections and Closing of a $15 Million Term Loan   Study Results Confirm Overall Antifungal Activity of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Candida Infections   Well-Tolerated and Active Oral Dose of SCY-078 Identified for Invasive Candidiasis Patients   Evidence of Efficacy and Lower Relapse Rates versus Standard of Care in VVC Patients   Strong Cash Position to Accelerate and Expand Development of SCY-078 in Multiple Indications   JERSEY CITY, N.J., Oct. 05, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Drug development company SCYNEXIS, Inc. (Nasdaq:SCYX) today announced the complete results of its two recently completed Phase 2 studies as well as the closing of a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital Ltd. (Nasdaq:SLRC).   In the first study, treatment with oral SCY-078 in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), resulted in significantly better clinical cure rates and fewer recurrences of VVC at the four-month follow-up when compared to the standard of care (oral fluconazole). In the second study, which evaluated oral SCY-078 as a step down therapy in patients with invasive candidiasis, oral SCY-078 achieved the target exposure for efficacy and was well-tolerated.   ""We are delighted with these positive results that support the concept that a fungicidal product with high tissue penetration like SCY-078 could yield superior clinical outcomes,"" said David Angulo, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of SCYNEXIS.  ""We identified a well-tolerated oral dose that achieves our target exposure in invasive candidiasis patients, and further confirmed the antifungal activity of oral SCY-078 in two independent human models of Candida infections.  These results support our planned development of SCY-078 as the first drug in a novel antifungal class for the treatment of a broad range of fungal infections with growing unmet medical needs.""   Phase 2 Proof-of-Concept Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with VVC   The first study evaluated the effect of two dose regimens of SCY-078 in patients with moderate to severe VVC as a proof-of-concept study to support the development of SCY-078 in invasive candidiasis and other Candida infections. Clinical cure rate, defined as a resolution of signs and symptoms of infection without further antifungal treatment, is now the recommended primary endpoint per the latest FDA guidelines for VVC. As previously reported, clinical cure rate was higher for patients receiving oral SCY-078 compared to oral fluconazole at the test of cure visit (Day 24).  Additionally, follow-up data now available showed a high clinical cure rate at the four-month visit (end of observation period) of 88% in patients who received SCY-078 compared to 65% in patients who received fluconazole (p=0.04). Moreover, during the four-month observation period, patients who received SCY-078 had a lower recurrence rate (4%) versus fluconazole (15%).   Phase 2 Study of Oral SCY-078 in Patients with Invasive Candidiasis   The second study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and tolerability of SCY-078 as an oral step-down treatment in patients initially treated with intravenous (IV) echinocandin therapy for invasive Candida infections.  Twenty-two patients were randomized to receive study drug or standard of care (one of the patients randomized to standard of care could not receive oral fluconazole due to a Candida glabrata with decreased fluconazole-susceptibility and received micafungin for the entire duration of antifungal therapy). As previously reported, the study met its primary objective by confirming the once daily oral dose of SCY-078 750mg as a dose that is both overall safe and tolerated and achieves the target exposure in these patients. During the study period, there were no reports of mycological failures in the SCY-078 750mg group (n=7) versus two infection-related failures (one fungemia and one abdominal sepsis) in the fluconazole group (n=7).  No relapses were observed in these two groups during the six-week follow-up period.   As previously reported, SCY-078 was overall safe and tolerated in both studies. There were no discontinuations due to adverse events (AEs) and no related serious AEs. Consistent with previous findings, the most common AEs were mild to moderate gastrointestinal (GI) events such as diarrhea nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain or discomfort. In patients with invasive candidiasis, the number of GI events were comparable in both the SCY-078 and fluconazole treatment arms.   ""We achieved our stated goals and further de-risked the development of our lead product candidate, SCY-078,"" said Marco Taglietti, M.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of SCYNEXIS. ""With these positive Phase 2 data in hand, we believe SCY-078 is now the most advanced novel agent in a new antifungal class that can address the growing issue of resistance. We are also pleased to announce the infusion of additional funds from Solar Capital, providing us with the financial strength and flexibility to accelerate and expand the development of SCY-078 and to leverage our internal antifungal platform.""   Additional Capital Raised   SCYNEXIS closed a $15 million term loan with Solar Capital, fully funded at close.  This transaction complements the company's recent equity raise, and results in minimal dilution to shareholders.  Please refer to the Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for additional information about the facility.   ""Solar Capital is pleased to start a financing partnership with SCYNEXIS that should enable the company to expand its pipeline of indications for SCY-078, as well as accelerate its other development programs,"" said Anthony Storino, head of life science lending at Solar Capital. ""We believe SCYNEXIS offers a unique value proposition in an area with significant unmet medical needs, and we are excited to contribute to the company's growth and future successes.""   As of September 30, 2016, SCYNEXIS' preliminary estimate of its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $58.4 million, including the $15 million from the loan facility.   Armentum Partners acted as financial advisor to SCYNEXIS on the loan facility.

Rucaparib NDA Dataset to be presented in oral presentation today at ESMO
Rucaparib NDA currently under priority review with FDA
Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date is February 23, 2017
European Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) submission planned for Q4 2016
Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ:CLVS) announced today the oral presentation of the primary efficacy and safety data from its NDA dataset for rucaparib at the 2016 ESMO Congress in Copenhagen. Rucaparib is currently under priority review with FDA for the monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies, and the submission has a PDUFA date of February 23, 2017.

Rucaparib is the Company’s oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP1, PARP2 and PARP3 currently being developed for the treatment of ovarian cancer, specifically in patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA, including those with high genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) also known as “BRCA-like."" The current NDA submission seeks approval in patients with tumor BRCA mutations, which includes both germline and somatic mutations.

“These results demonstrate that rucaparib may represent an important option for women with multiply relapsed BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer based on its encouraging efficacy and tolerability,” said Rebecca S. Kristeleit, MD, PhD, The University College London, Cancer Institute, London, UK. “In my opinion, rucaparib has the hallmarks of an important new therapeutic option for ovarian cancer patients.”

“We are pleased to present the primary efficacy and safety dataset that has been submitted to the FDA as the basis of our NDA for rucaparib in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. If approved, rucaparib would be the first PARP inhibitor in the U.S. indicated to treat ovarian cancer patients with germline or somatic BRCA mutations who have received two prior chemotherapies. Women with BRCA mutations represent about 25% of patients in the US living with ovarian cancer,” said Patrick J. Mahaffy, CEO and President of Clovis Oncology. “Our NDA review is ongoing with FDA, and in addition we are actively preparing for a European submission during the fourth quarter of 2016.”

Data from subgroups of two multicenter, single-arm open-label phase 2 studies, Study 10 (NCT01482715) and ARIEL2 (NCT01891344) were combined for an integrated efficacy and safety analysis which further characterized the clinical benefit of rucaparib at the recommended starting dose of 600 mg BID in women with advanced ovarian cancer. In the two studies, 377 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the safety population (diagnosis of ovarian cancer and having received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib), and 106 patients met the criteria for inclusion in the efficacy population (received 2 or more prior chemotherapies, including 2 or more platinum-based regimens, had a mutation of BRCA (germline or somatic), and received one or more doses of the recommended dose of 600 mg of rucaparib.

The major efficacy outcome measure for this analysis was objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the investigator according to RECIST. All responses were confirmed.

For the efficacy population (n=106), the median number of prior chemotherapies was three, with 39% having received two prior therapies and 61% of patients having received three or more prior therapies. The median number of prior platinum-based therapies was two, with 57% having received two prior platinum-based therapies, and 43% having received three or more prior platinum-based therapies. Seventy-five percent of patients in the efficacy population were platinum-sensitive (as defined by recurrence after progression free interval (PFI) of ≥6 months), 19% were platinum resistant (recurrence after PFI <6 months) and 7% were platinum refractory (progression on platinum, PFI <2 months).

Summary of Efficacy Data

The RECIST ORR (objective response rate as assessed by the investigator, which includes complete and partial responses) in the efficacy population was 57/106, or 54% (95% CI: 43.8-63.5). This includes nine (9%) complete responders (CR) and 48 (45%) partial responders (PR). Thirty-six patients (34%) had stable disease (SD) as the best response, while nine patients (9%) had progressive disease (PD) as the best response and four (4%) were not evaluable (NE). Seventy-five of 106 patients, or 71% (95% CI: 61.1-79.2) had a RECIST or CA-125 response.

For the 42 patients from Study 10 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 25/42, or 60% (95% CI: 43.3-74.4). This included four CRs (10%) and 21 PRs (50%). In addition, 12 patients (29%) had SD, two patients (5%) had PD and three (7%) were NE. For the 64 patients from ARIEL2 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 32/64, or 50% (95% CI: 37.2-62.8). This included five CRs (8%) and 27 PRs (42%). In addition, 24 patients (38%) had SD, seven (11%) had PD and one (2%) was NE. Study 10 was limited to platinum sensitive patients; ARIEL2 included platinum sensitive, platinum resistant and platinum refractory patients.

In addition, ORR was assessed by subgroups including BRCA mutation type, number of prior chemotherapies and prior platinum regimens, PFI and platinum status. Patients with a BRCA1 (n=67) or BRCA2 (n=39) mutation both showed an ORR of 54% (95% CI: 41.1-66.0, 37.2-69.9, respectively) in line with the overall population. The ORR for patients with germline BRCA mutations (n=88) and somatic BRCA mutations (n=13) was 53% (95% CI: 42.5-64.1) and 46% (95% CI: 19.2-74.9), respectively; in addition, five patients with a BRCA mutation but unknown germline or somatic status had an ORR of 80% (95% CI: 28.4-99.5). Patients who received two prior chemotherapies (n=41) achieved an ORR of 68% (95% CI: 51.9-81.9). Patients who received two prior platinum regimens (n=60) demonstrated an ORR of 65% (95% CI: 51.6-76.9). Response by length of PFI differed for patients with PFI<6 months (n=27), 6-12 months (n=56) and greater than 12 months (n=23), reporting 19% (95% CI: 6.3-38.1), 63% (95% CI: 48.6-75.1) and 74% (95% CI: 51.6-89.8), respectively. Response by platinum status was reported as 0% (95% CI: 0.0-41.0) for platinum-refractory patients (n=7), 25% (95% CI: 8.7-49.1) for platinum-resistant patients (n=20), and 66% (95% CI: 54.3-76.1) for platinum-sensitive patients (n=79).

Duration of response by investigator assessment in the efficacy population was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.7 months), and the censoring rate among responders was 47%. As of the cutoff dates, 20 patients with a RECIST response had an ongoing response.

Additionally, analyses not contained within the NDA submission showed median progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the efficacy population to be 10.0 months. Of 106 patients, 50 patients did not have an event of disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of these 50 patients, 32 patients were still on treatment, and 18 patients discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of note, 79% of patients remained progression-free at six months, and 41% remained progression-free at 12 months.

For the efficacy dataset, the cut off dates were November 30, 2015 and February 29, 2016, for Study 10 and ARIEL2, respectively.

Summary of Safety Data

Of the 377 ovarian cancer patients treated with a starting dose of rucaparib 600 mg, 377 (100%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) of any grade, and 229 (61%) experienced a treatment-emergent AE grade 3 or higher. A total of 360 patients (96%) experienced a treatment-related AE of any grade, and 177 (47%) experienced a treatment-related AE that was grade 3 or higher. AEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 221 patients (59%). Treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 167 patients (44%), and treatment discontinuation in 30 patients (8%). The primary reasons for dose reduction were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (17%), asthenia/fatigue (14%) and nausea (11%). The primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were asthenia/fatigue (2%), small intestinal obstruction (2%) and nausea (1%). Nine patients (2%) had AEs that led to death; eight were due to disease progression, and one death was due to sepsis, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.

The most common treatment-emergent AEs (all grades) reported in ≥20 percent of patients included nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), increased ALT/AST (41%) and constipation (40%). The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥10 percent of patients were anemia (25%), asthenia/fatigue (11%) and ALT/AST elevations (11%).

The increases in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase levels that were observed were asymptomatic, reversible and were rarely associated with increases in bilirubin. The elevations normalized over time with continued rucaparib treatment.

Mild to moderate creatinine elevations were observed within the first few weeks of treatment for most patients, for whom 79 (21%) experienced an AE, of whom two (0.5%) experienced a grade 3/4 event. These elevations in creatinine likely result from inhibition of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine in the absence of renal injury.

Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia was reported in less than one percent of patients.

The cut-off dates for the safety dataset were March 31, 2016 for Study 10 and April 29, 2016 for ARIEL2.

About Rucaparib

Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3 being developed for advanced ovarian cancer.

Specifically, rucaparib is being developed as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with deleterious BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations (as detected by an FDA-approved test) who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Rucaparib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for this proposed indication by the U.S. FDA in April 2015; and in late June 2016, Clovis completed its New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. The filing for treatment was accepted and has an action date of February 23, 2017. Rucaparib’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency for the proposed treatment indication is planned for Q4 2016.

Foundation Medicine, Clovis’ companion diagnostic partner, has submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application for its FoundationFocus CDxBRCA to the FDA in June 2016. The test is designed to identify tumor BRCA mutations. The timing of the submission is expected to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic in a similar timeframe.

Additionally, rucaparib is being developed as maintenance therapy in the ARIEL3 trial (NCT01968213) for patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA (commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies, or HRD). Data from ARIEL3 are expected in Q4 2017, which is expected to be followed by the submission of a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy.

Clovis is also exploring rucaparib in other solid tumor types with BRCA mutations or molecular evidence of the HRD signature, including prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.

Clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib.

About Ovarian Cancer

According to the American Cancer Society, more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. during 2016. There are often no clearly identifiable initial symptoms, and in an estimated 80 to 85% of ovarian cancer cases, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before a person is diagnosed and can be treated. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. One in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic BRCA mutation, and new treatment options are needed to treat unique patient populations.

All responses were confirmed.  For the efficacy population (n=106), the median number of prior chemotherapies was three, with 39% having received two prior therapies and 61% of patients having received three or more prior therapies. The median number of prior platinum-based therapies was two, with 57% having received two prior platinum-based therapies, and 43% having received three or more prior platinum-based therapies. Seventy-five percent of patients in the efficacy population were platinum-sensitive (as defined by recurrence after progression free interval (PFI) of ≥6 months), 19% were platinum resistant (recurrence after PFI <6 months) and 7% were platinum refractory (progression on platinum, PFI <2 months).  Summary of Efficacy Data  The RECIST ORR (objective response rate as assessed by the investigator, which includes complete and partial responses) in the efficacy population was 57/106, or 54% (95% CI: 43.8-63.5). This includes nine (9%) complete responders (CR) and 48 (45%) partial responders (PR). Thirty-six patients (34%) had stable disease (SD) as the best response, while nine patients (9%) had progressive disease (PD) as the best response and four (4%) were not evaluable (NE). Seventy-five of 106 patients, or 71% (95% CI: 61.1-79.2) had a RECIST or CA-125 response.  For the 42 patients from Study 10 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 25/42, or 60% (95% CI: 43.3-74.4). This included four CRs (10%) and 21 PRs (50%). In addition, 12 patients (29%) had SD, two patients (5%) had PD and three (7%) were NE. For the 64 patients from ARIEL2 included in the efficacy population, the RECIST ORR was 32/64, or 50% (95% CI: 37.2-62.8). This included five CRs (8%) and 27 PRs (42%). In addition, 24 patients (38%) had SD, seven (11%) had PD and one (2%) was NE. Study 10 was limited to platinum sensitive patients; ARIEL2 included platinum sensitive, platinum resistant and platinum refractory patients.  In addition, ORR was assessed by subgroups including BRCA mutation type, number of prior chemotherapies and prior platinum regimens, PFI and platinum status. Patients with a BRCA1 (n=67) or BRCA2 (n=39) mutation both showed an ORR of 54% (95% CI: 41.1-66.0, 37.2-69.9, respectively) in line with the overall population. The ORR for patients with germline BRCA mutations (n=88) and somatic BRCA mutations (n=13) was 53% (95% CI: 42.5-64.1) and 46% (95% CI: 19.2-74.9), respectively; in addition, five patients with a BRCA mutation but unknown germline or somatic status had an ORR of 80% (95% CI: 28.4-99.5). Patients who received two prior chemotherapies (n=41) achieved an ORR of 68% (95% CI: 51.9-81.9). Patients who received two prior platinum regimens (n=60) demonstrated an ORR of 65% (95% CI: 51.6-76.9). Response by length of PFI differed for patients with PFI<6 months (n=27), 6-12 months (n=56) and greater than 12 months (n=23), reporting 19% (95% CI: 6.3-38.1), 63% (95% CI: 48.6-75.1) and 74% (95% CI: 51.6-89.8), respectively. Response by platinum status was reported as 0% (95% CI: 0.0-41.0) for platinum-refractory patients (n=7), 25% (95% CI: 8.7-49.1) for platinum-resistant patients (n=20), and 66% (95% CI: 54.3-76.1) for platinum-sensitive patients (n=79).  Duration of response by investigator assessment in the efficacy population was 9.2 months (95% CI: 6.6-11.7 months), and the censoring rate among responders was 47%. As of the cutoff dates, 20 patients with a RECIST response had an ongoing response.  Additionally, analyses not contained within the NDA submission showed median progression-free survival by investigator assessment in the efficacy population to be 10.0 months. Of 106 patients, 50 patients did not have an event of disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of these 50 patients, 32 patients were still on treatment, and 18 patients discontinued treatment for reasons other than disease progression or death at the data cut-off dates. Of note, 79% of patients remained progression-free at six months, and 41% remained progression-free at 12 months.  For the efficacy dataset, the cut off dates were November 30, 2015 and February 29, 2016, for Study 10 and ARIEL2, respectively.  Summary of Safety Data  Of the 377 ovarian cancer patients treated with a starting dose of rucaparib 600 mg, 377 (100%) experienced a treatment-emergent adverse event (AE) of any grade, and 229 (61%) experienced a treatment-emergent AE grade 3 or higher. A total of 360 patients (96%) experienced a treatment-related AE of any grade, and 177 (47%) experienced a treatment-related AE that was grade 3 or higher. AEs leading to dose interruption occurred in 221 patients (59%). Treatment-related AEs leading to dose reduction occurred in 167 patients (44%), and treatment discontinuation in 30 patients (8%). The primary reasons for dose reduction were anemia/decreased hemoglobin (17%), asthenia/fatigue (14%) and nausea (11%). The primary reasons for treatment discontinuation were asthenia/fatigue (2%), small intestinal obstruction (2%) and nausea (1%). Nine patients (2%) had AEs that led to death; eight were due to disease progression, and one death was due to sepsis, which was assessed by the investigator to be unrelated to treatment.  The most common treatment-emergent AEs (all grades) reported in ≥20 percent of patients included nausea (77%), asthenia/fatigue (77%), vomiting (46%), anemia (44%), increased ALT/AST (41%) and constipation (40%). The most common Grade 3/4 treatment-emergent AEs reported in ≥10 percent of patients were anemia (25%), asthenia/fatigue (11%) and ALT/AST elevations (11%).  The increases in aspartate (AST) and alanine (ALT) aminotransferase levels that were observed were asymptomatic, reversible and were rarely associated with increases in bilirubin. The elevations normalized over time with continued rucaparib treatment.  Mild to moderate creatinine elevations were observed within the first few weeks of treatment for most patients, for whom 79 (21%) experienced an AE, of whom two (0.5%) experienced a grade 3/4 event. These elevations in creatinine likely result from inhibition of the renal transporters MATE1 and MATE2-K, which can lead to an increase in serum creatinine in the absence of renal injury.  Myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia was reported in less than one percent of patients.  The cut-off dates for the safety dataset were March 31, 2016 for Study 10 and April 29, 2016 for ARIEL2.  Presentation Details  The oral presentation, titled “Clinical activity of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor rucaparib in patients (pts) with high grade ovarian carcinoma (HGOC) and a BRCA mutation (BRCAmut): Analysis of pooled data from Study 10 (parts 1, 2a, and 3) and ARIEL2 (parts 1 and 2)” was presented today by Rebecca S. Kristeleit, PhD, The University College London, Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom during the Session titled “Gynecological Cancers”, from 2:00pm-3:30pm CEST (Abstract 856O: 2:45pm-3:00pm CEST).  The Trials-in-Progress poster presentation, titled “Window study of the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in patients with primary triple negative or BRCA1/2 related breast cancer (RIO)” is being presented Monday by Christy Toms, PhD, The Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom during the Poster Session titled “Breast Cancer, Early Stage” from 1:00pm-2:00pm CEST (Abstract 219TiP, Poster Board #219).  The presentations will be available online at http://clovisoncology.com/products-companion-diagnostics/scientific-presentations/ at the time of their scheduled presentation at the Congress.  About Rucaparib  Rucaparib is an oral, small molecule inhibitor of PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3 being developed for advanced ovarian cancer.  Specifically, rucaparib is being developed as monotherapy treatment of advanced ovarian cancer in patients with deleterious BRCA-mutated tumors inclusive of both germline and somatic BRCA mutations (as detected by an FDA-approved test) who have been treated with two or more chemotherapies. Rucaparib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for this proposed indication by the U.S. FDA in April 2015; and in late June 2016, Clovis completed its New Drug Application (NDA) submission to the FDA. The filing for treatment was accepted and has an action date of February 23, 2017. Rucaparib’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency for the proposed treatment indication is planned for Q4 2016.  Foundation Medicine, Clovis’ companion diagnostic partner, has submitted a Premarket Approval (PMA) application for its FoundationFocus CDxBRCA to the FDA in June 2016. The test is designed to identify tumor BRCA mutations. The timing of the submission is expected to allow for regulatory approval of the companion diagnostic in a similar timeframe.  Additionally, rucaparib is being developed as maintenance therapy in the ARIEL3 trial (NCT01968213) for patients with tumors with BRCA mutations and other DNA repair deficiencies beyond BRCA (commonly referred to as homologous recombination deficiencies, or HRD). Data from ARIEL3 are expected in Q4 2017, which is expected to be followed by the submission of a supplemental NDA for second-line maintenance therapy.  Clovis is also exploring rucaparib in other solid tumor types with BRCA mutations or molecular evidence of the HRD signature, including prostate, breast and gastroesophageal cancers.  Clovis holds worldwide rights for rucaparib.  About Ovarian Cancer  According to the American Cancer Society, more than 22,000 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in the U.S. during 2016. There are often no clearly identifiable initial symptoms, and in an estimated 80 to 85% of ovarian cancer cases, the cancer has spread to other parts of the body before a person is diagnosed and can be treated. Ovarian cancer ranks fifth in cancer deaths and causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system. One in four women with ovarian cancer have a germline or somatic BRCA mutation, and new treatment options are needed to treat unique patient populations.  About Clovis Oncology  Clovis Oncology, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing and commercializing innovative anti-cancer agents in the U.S., Europe and additional international markets. Clovis Oncology targets development programs at specific subsets of cancer populations, and simultaneously develops diagnostic tools that direct a compound in development to the population that is most likely to benefit from its use.

  COPENHAGEN, Oct. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TESARO, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSRO), an
oncology-focused biopharmaceutical company, and ENGOT, the European Network
for Gynaecological Oncological Trial groups, today announced the
presentation of the niraparib Phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA clinical trial results
at the ESMO 2016 Congress, the congress of the European Society for Medical
Oncology (ESMO), by Dr. Mansoor Raza Mirza, M.D., Medical Director of the
Nordic Society of Gynecologic Oncology (NSGO) and principal investigator on
the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial. These data were discussed during the ESMO press
briefing in Copenhagen as part of the congress, and were simultaneously
published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.(1) The results will
also be presented by Dr. Mirza later today during Presidential Symposium 1
(Abstract #LBA3_PR) at ESMO.

  ENGOT-OV16/NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3
trial of niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer
who were in response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. This
trial was designed to assess progression free survival (PFS) in a broad
population of patients who were assigned to one of two cohorts based upon
germline BRCA mutation status. The ENGOT-OV16/NOVA trial successfully
achieved its primary endpoint in both cohorts, demonstrating that niraparib
treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared to control in patients who
were germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut) carriers and in patients who were not
germline BRCA mutation (non-gBRCAmut) carriers. In addition, within the
non-gBRCA cohort, niraparib treatment significantly prolonged PFS compared
to control for the prospectively defined patient population with tumors
deficient in homologous recombination (HRDpos) as determined by the Myriad
myChoice(R) HRD test. A high proportion of patients in both treatment groups
in both cohorts had received three or more prior lines of chemotherapy.
  ""These landmark results are extremely encouraging for the ovarian cancer
community,"" said Dr. Mirza. ""The effectiveness of platinum-based
chemotherapy diminishes over time, and PFS and platinum-free intervals
generally become shorter after each round of platinum treatment. In
addition, the incidence of infection and risk of neuropathy and
hypersensitivity with certain chemotherapy agents rises with subsequent
cycles. An oral maintenance treatment that could lengthen the PFS interval
between rounds of platinum-based chemotherapy would be very meaningful for
patients with ovarian cancer, who often live with a fear of recurrence after
ending active treatment.""
  ""We would like to thank the patients, their families and the caregivers that
participated in the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA study, as well as our partners at ENGOT
for their diligence in executing this trial,"" said Mary Lynne Hedley, Ph.D.,
President and COO of TESARO. ""We believe the results of this Phase 3 study
demonstrated a meaningful benefit for women with platinum sensitive,
recurrent ovarian cancer.""
  Primary Endpoint Results:
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the gBRCAmut Cohort
  Among patients who were germline BRCA mutation carriers, the niraparib arm
successfully achieved statistical significance over the control arm for the
primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.27 (95% CI, 0.173-0.410).
The median PFS for patients treated with niraparib was 21.0 months, compared
to 5.5 months for control (p<0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in the non-gBRCAmut Cohort
  Niraparib showed statistical significance for patients in the non-germline
BRCA mutant cohort. The niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical
significance over the control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a
hazard ratio of 0.45 (95% CI, 0.338-0.607). The median PFS for patients
treated with niraparib was 9.3 months, compared to 3.9 months for control
(p<0.0001).
  Statistically Significant PFS Results in non-gBRCAmut Cohort for Patients
with HRD-Positive Tumors
  For patients who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers but whose tumors
were determined to be HRD positive using the Myriad myChoice(R) HRD test,
the niraparib arm successfully achieved statistical significance over the
control arm for the primary endpoint of PFS, with a hazard ratio of 0.38
(95% CI, 0.243-0.586). The median PFS for patients with HRD-positive tumors
who were treated with niraparib was 12.9 months, compared to 3.8 months for
control (p<0.0001).
  Secondary Endpoint Results:
  Secondary endpoint analyses, including chemotherapy-free interval, time to
first subsequent treatment, and PFS 2 were all statistically significant and
favored niraparib over control for patients in both the gBRCAmut and
non-gBRCAmut cohorts. Patient-reported outcome results from validated survey
tools indicated that niraparib-treated patients reported no difference from
control in measures associated with quality of life. Data for overall
survival are immature (HR 0.73; 95% CI, 0.480 to 1.125; p=0.1545), as fewer
than 20% of events had occurred at the time of analysis.
  Safety Results:
  The most common (>=10%) treatment-emergent grade 3/4 adverse events in the
niraparib arm were thrombocytopenia (33.8%), anemia (25.3%), and neutropenia
(19.6%) with treatment discontinuation for these events of 3.3%, 1.4% and
1.9%, respectively. Thrombocytopenia was not associated with grade 3/4
bleeding events. The majority of these hematological laboratory
abnormalities occurred within the first three cycles; following dose
modifications the incidence of these lab abnormalities decreased and
thrombocytopenia and neutropenia were infrequent beyond cycle 3. The rates
of MDS/AML in the niraparib (1.4%) and control (1.1%) arms were similar.
There were no deaths among patients during study treatment.
  ""Despite diagnostic and treatment advances, ovarian cancer remains the
deadliest gynecologic cancer, and the need for new therapeutic options that
prolong response remains critical,"" said David Barley, CEO of the National
Ovarian Cancer Coalition. ""The results of the NOVA trial are encouraging,
and could offer patients and their families a treatment option during the
stressful period that follows platinum-based chemotherapy where the majority
of patients receive no treatment.""

  About the Phase 3 ENGOT-OV16/NOVA Clinical Trial of Niraparib
  NOVA is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, international Phase 3 trial of
niraparib that enrolled 553 patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who were
in a response to their most recent platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients
were enrolled into one of two independent cohorts based on germline BRCA
mutation status. One cohort enrolled patients who were germline BRCA
mutation carriers (gBRCAmut), and the second cohort enrolled patients who
were not germline BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut) and included
patients with HRD-positive and HRD-negative tumors. Within each cohort,
patients were randomized 2:1 to receive niraparib or placebo and were
treated continuously with placebo or 300 milligrams of niraparib, dosed as
three 100 milligram tablets once per day, until progression. The primary
endpoint of this study was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary
endpoints include patient-reported outcomes, chemotherapy-free interval
length, PFS 2, overall survival, and other measures of safety and
tolerability.  More information about this trial is available at
http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01847274.
  About Niraparib
  Niraparib is an oral, once-daily PARP inhibitor that is currently being
evaluated in four ongoing pivotal trials. TESARO is building a robust

Therapeutic Profile
  PR Newswire
  EDISON, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016
  EDISON, N.J., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today reported positive
interim data for CMX157, the Company's highly potent prodrug of tenofovir,
from its ongoing Phase 2a multiple ascending dose clinical study.  The
head-to-head study is the first evaluation of CMX157 in HBV patients, and
directly compares CMX157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Gilead's
Viread(R) ) in chronically infected hepatitis B (HBV) patients.
  Patients successfully completed both 5 mg and 10 mg cohorts, and interim
data reported below are from 10 HBV-infected patients who completed 14 days
of once-a-day oral dosing of 25 mg of CMX157, and two HBV patients treated
for 14 days of oral dosing with 300 mg TDF.  The CMX157 treated patients
showed an average 99% reduction in HBV viral load compared to baseline.
Significantly, the observed antiviral activity for CMX157 is comparable to
that observed in TDF-treated patients, but at 1/12(th) the dose (25 mg
CMX157 vs. standard 300 mg TDF).
  A key goal of this study was to monitor levels of active tenofovir in the
blood, exposure to which is a key predictor of off-target side effects.
Following oral dosing, levels of CMX157 and active tenofovir in the
bloodstream are approximately dose proportional and similar both in chronic
HBV patients as well as in an earlier healthy volunteer study. Notably,
CMX157 does not appear to break down readily into active tenofovir in the
blood (tenofovir: Cmax = 2.8 ng/mL; AUC = 34 ng*h/mL) in contrast to
patients taking Viread(R) (tenofovir: Cmax 340 ng/mL, AUC 1910 ng*h/mL). The
high levels of circulating tenofovir in subjects taking Viread(R) are
consistent with results from earlier published clinical studies of Viread(R)
in HIV and HBV patients.  These results are significant considering that
CMX157 achieved similar antiviral activity compared to Viread(R) while
significantly reducing systemic tenofovir exposure.
  Active tenofovir levels observed in blood following oral dosing of CMX157
are significantly below levels seen for Viread(R) -treated patients,
regardless of dose used, which is consistent with CMX157 targeting the liver
followed by activation of CMX157 specifically within the liver.  This is
further supported by the observation that viral load reductions with CMX157
are comparable to Viread(R) despite a significantly lower dose.
  ""We are pleased and excited with these clinical results, as they demonstrate
CMX157's great potential in our ongoing effort to develop a cure for HBV,""
said James Sapirstein, CEO of ContraVir.  ""The significant viral load
reduction and favorable safety at this low dose of CMX157 speaks to the
unique liver-targeting mechanism of our drug, which concentrates the
antiviral activity of tenofovir in the liver, enabling anti-HBV efficacy at
lower doses and minimal drug exposure to other tissues.  We believe, based
on the data that are being generated, that CMX157 has great potential as a
safe and highly potent backbone of combination therapy against HBV.""
  Pharmacokinetic data observed for CMX157 to date in healthy and HBV-infected
subjects are similar across the completed Phase 1b and ongoing Phase 2a
studies, consistent with the prodrug's site of action and anticipated
improved safety profile.  CMX157 was earlier found to be safe and well
tolerated at daily oral doses of up to 100 mg in healthy volunteers and is
presently demonstrating an excellent safety profile at 25 mg dose in the
ongoing Phase 2a study in HBV patients.  Upon completion of the 4-week
dosing regimen and independent safety review, dose escalation is planned to
continue at the 50 mg and 100 mg levels, respectively.  Similarity of
pharmacokinetic profiles observed for CMX157 in healthy and HBV-infected
subjects strongly suggests that the remaining 50 mg and 100 mg doses of
CMX157 in the ongoing Phase 2a study will also be safe and potentially even
more active against HBV.
  CMX157 Phase 2 Clinical Trial Design
  The Phase 2a multiple ascending dose clinical trial is designed to enroll 60
treatment-na&#239;ve patients with chronic HBV infection, and to compare
CMX157 to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF, Gilead's Viread(R) ).  The
sequential dose escalation format consists of 10 patients per cohort
receiving four weeks of a once-daily dose of 5, 10, 25, 50 and 100 mg,
respectively, of CMX157, plus two patients per cohort receiving 300 mg of
TDF, the standard therapeutic dose of Viread(R) .
  About CMX157
  CMX157 is a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir.
 Its novel liver-targeting structure results in decreased circulating levels
of tenofovir, lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential
for renal side effects.  CMX157 previously completed a Phase 1b dose
escalation clinical study conducted in healthy volunteers, in which
participants were treated at doses up to 100 mg per day for 14 days,
displaying an excellent safety, tolerability, and drug distribution profile.
 Based on CMX157's best-in-class potential, ContraVir believes CMX157 can
become the cornerstone of a curative combination therapy for hepatitis B.

  The interim analysis of Day 90 follow-up for all 501 patients, as well as
top-line data from Day 180 follow-up for up to 200 patients, will be
presented in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session at the AHA Scientific
Sessions 2016 on November 15, 2016 in New Orleans. In order to protect the
scientific integrity of the ongoing ORION-1 study, the Company does not
expect to provide additional information or make further public statements
regarding the results of the study in advance of the ORION-1 presentation at
the AHA Scientific Sessions. The Company anticipates that data from Day 180
follow-up in all 501 patients will be completed, analyzed and top-line
results disclosed before the end of 2016.
  About ORION-1
  ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, dose-finding
Phase 2 trial of single or multiple subcutaneous injections of PCSK9si in a
total of 501 patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or
ASCVD-risk equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia)
and elevated LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering
therapies. The trial compares the effect of different doses of PCSK9si and
evaluates the potential for dosing no more than two, three or four times per
year.
  About PCSK9si (also known as ALN-PCSsc)
  PCSK9si is an investigational proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9
(PCSK9) synthesis inhibitor, which acts via RNA interference, being
developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a
genetically-validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism. In
contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in
blood, PCSK9si is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by
inhibiting PCSK9 synthesis in the liver.
  In a previous, single-ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to
82.3 +/- 2.0 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1 percent with mean
maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0 percent. At Day 180, a single dose of
PCSK9si was associated with an up to 53 percent reduction in LDL-C, with a
least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0 percent in the 300 mg dose
cohort.
  In a previous multiple ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to
88.5 +/- 1.6 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0 percent with mean
maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4 percent.
  PCSK9si was generally well tolerated following single and multiple
subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or
discontinuations due to adverse events.
  The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the
advancement of PCSK9si per their agreement formed in early 2013. Under the
terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and
the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding
the development of PCSK9si from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential
commercialization.

The trial compares the effect of different doses of PCSK9si and evaluates the potential for dosing no more than two, three or four times per year.   About PCSK9si (also known as ALN-PCSsc)   PCSK9si is an investigational proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) synthesis inhibitor, which acts via RNA interference, being developed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 is a genetically-validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism. In contrast to anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, PCSK9si is a first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by inhibiting PCSK9 synthesis in the liver.   In a previous, single-ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0 percent. At Day 180, a single dose of PCSK9si was associated with an up to 53 percent reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0 percent in the 300 mg dose cohort.   In a previous multiple ascending dose study, PCSK9si was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4 percent with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6 percent and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0 percent with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4 percent.   PCSK9si was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in the advancement of PCSK9si per their agreement formed in early 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of PCSK9si from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.   About The Medicines Company   The Medicines Company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose--to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. The Company's mission is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in three critical therapeutic areas: serious infectious disease care, cardiovascular care and surgery and perioperative care.

Alkermes plc (NASDAQ: ALKS) today announced positive topline results from FORWARD-5, the third phase 3 efficacy study to read out from the FORWARD pivotal program for ALKS 5461, a once-daily, oral investigational medicine with a novel mechanism of action for the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in patients with an inadequate response to standard antidepressant therapies. The study met its prespecified primary endpoint showing treatment with ALKS 5461 significantly reduced symptoms of depression in patients with MDD compared to placebo. ALKS 5461 was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse events observed for ALKS 5461 were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. Based on these results, along with the substantial data collected to date on the efficacy and safety of ALKS 5461 for the treatment of MDD, the company plans to request a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Division of Psychiatric Products to discuss the filing strategy for this Fast Track designated medicine.

“We designed ALKS 5461 to have a novel mechanism of action for the treatment of MDD, a serious disease where new therapeutic options are highly sought after as millions of patients in the U.S. do not respond to standard courses of antidepressant therapy,” said Elliot Ehrich, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Alkermes. “With the successful completion of the FORWARD-5 study and data from more than 1,500 patients to date, we have established a strong foundation of evidence of ALKS 5461’s clinical utility in the adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. With these data now in hand, we will move forward rapidly to meet with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps toward a regulatory submission for ALKS 5461, with a goal of bringing this important new medication to patients with MDD.”

“ALKS 5461 embodies our dedication to developing novel and safe CNS medicines that address compelling unmet needs faced by large numbers of patients,” said Richard Pops, Chief Executive Officer of Alkermes. “Major depressive disorder affects millions of people and their families, and represents one of the greatest burdens of suffering and cost of any disease today. New drug development in the field is challenging and we are excited to advance ALKS 5461 in this important indication.”

In the study, ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg met the prespecified primary endpoint of significantly reducing depression scores compared to placebo, as measured by 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) scores (p=0.018). ALKS 5461 2mg/2mg also demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 10-item MADRS (MADRS-10) scores compared to placebo (p=0.026). The 1mg/1mg dose of ALKS 5461 showed improvement in depressive symptoms in the study, but did not separate significantly from placebo.

The most commonly reported adverse events for ALKS 5461 in the FORWARD-5 study were nausea, dizziness and fatigue. These findings are consistent with those observed in previously reported studies of ALKS 5461. Alkermes will present comprehensive data from FORWARD-5 at an upcoming medical meeting and submit the results for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.

About the FORWARD-5 Study
FORWARD-5 was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study that evaluated the safety, tolerability and efficacy of two dose levels of ALKS 5461 (2mg/2mg and 1mg/1mg) as adjunctive treatment in patients with MDD who had an inadequate response to a stable dose of either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). The study randomized 407 subjects.

The study was conducted in two sequential stages: Stage 1 was 5 weeks in duration, Stage 2 was 6 weeks. In Stage 1, the average change from baseline depression scores was calculated for weeks 3 through 5. For Stage 2, the average change was calculated for weeks 3 through 6. The results of Stages 1 and 2 were then averaged. Depression scores were assessed using the 6-item Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-6) and MADRS-10. MADRS-6, a subscale of the MADRS-10 assessment tool for depression, focuses on the core symptoms of depression.

About the FORWARD Clinical Program
The FORWARD (Focused On Results With A Rethinking of Depression) pivotal program for ALKS 5461 includes three core phase 3 efficacy studies, as well as additional supportive studies to evaluate the long-term safety, dosing, pharmacokinetic profile and human abuse potential of ALKS 5461. FORWARD-5 is the third phase 3 efficacy study to read out from the FORWARD program. Results from FORWARD-3 and FORWARD-4 were announced in January 2016 and detailed data were presented at the American Society of Clinical Psychopharmacology (ASCP) in June 2016.

BIIB,11/7/16,Biotech,Clinical,BusinessWire,Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals Announce SPINRAZA (nusinersen) Meets Primary Endpoint at Interim Analysis of Phase 3 CHERISH Study in Later-Onset Spinal Muscular Atrophy,S.BW BIIB IONS BIOTC.BW .BIOTECH CA.BW .CA CLINT.BW FDA.BW .FDA HEALTG.BW .HEALTH GENET.BW HEALT.BW MNGDCA.BW PHARM.BW .PHARMA PHOTOMULT.BW PRODU.BW .PRODUCT .NASDAQ,"- Second Positive Phase 3 Study Provides Further Evidence of SPINRAZA’s Efficacy and Favorable Safety Profile -

- Results Were Statistically Significant and Clinically Meaningful -

Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Ionis Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IONS) announced that SPINRAZATM (nusinersen), an investigational treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), met the primary endpoint at the interim analysis of CHERISH, the Phase 3 study evaluating SPINRAZA in later-onset (consistent with Type 2) SMA. The analysis found that children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study.

“These results, along with our successful trial in infantile-onset SMA, reinforce the potential of SPINRAZA to benefit a broad range of SMA patients,” said Michael Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, head of Research and Development at Biogen. “We will make regulators around the globe aware of this data and will continue working closely with them to bring SPINRAZA to families affected by SMA as quickly as possible.”

Biogen is preparing for the potential launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S. possibly as early as the end of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.

Results From the CHERISH Interim Analysis

CHERISH is a fifteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2), including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening.

Results from the primary endpoint of the pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a difference of 5.9 points (p= 0.0000002) at 15 months between the treatment (n=84) and sham-controlled (n=42) study arms, as measured by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). From baseline to 15 months of treatment, patients who received SPINRAZA achieved a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the HFMSE, while patients who were not on treatment declined by a mean of 1.9 points. The HFMSE is a reliable and validated tool specifically designed to assess motor function in children with SMA, and a change of three points or greater in the HFMSE has previously been identified as clinically meaningful. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The majority of the adverse events were considered to be either related to SMA disease, common events in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. No patients discontinued the study.

With the positive interim analysis, the CHERISH study will be stopped and participants will be able to transition into the SHINE open-label extension study to receive SPINRAZA. Full study results will be presented at future medical congresses.

“These data further validate the potential of SPINRAZA as a treatment for patients with SMA,” said B. Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer of Ionis Pharmaceuticals. “We are grateful to all the families and clinicians who have participated in all of the SPINRAZA studies. Without their commitment and support, this program would not have been able to progress so quickly.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for SPINRAZA as a treatment for SMA and communicated they plan to act early on the NDA under an expedited review. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently validated Biogen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the EU. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted Accelerated Assessment status and the FDA granted Priority Review to SPINRAZA. Biogen is initiating regulatory filings in other countries in the coming months.

Biogen initiated a global expanded access program (EAP) in infantile-onset SMA earlier this year. The company will continue to explore where and when the EAP may be broadened to include patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2).

The SPINRAZA Clinical Trial Program

SPINRAZA has been studied in both presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SMA including patients likely to develop or diagnosed with SMA Types 1, 2, and 3.

The SPINRAZA Phase 3 program is comprised of two registrational studies, ENDEAR and CHERISH. ENDEAR is a thirteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 122 patients with infantile-onset SMA, including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms of SMA at up to six months of age. The endpoint pre-specified for the interim analysis of the study evaluated the proportion of motor milestone responders from the motor component of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). Given the results of the positive interim analysis, the ENDEAR study is being stopped and participants are able to transition into the SHINE open-label study, in which all patients will receive SPINRAZA.

Additionally, the SHINE open-label extension study for patients who previously participated in ENDEAR or CHERISH is open and is intended to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA.

Two additional Phase 2 studies, EMBRACE and NURTURE, were designed to collect additional data on SPINRAZA. EMBRACE is studying a small subset of patients with infantile or later-onset SMA who do not meet the age and other criteria of ENDEAR or CHERISH. NURTURE is an open-label, ongoing study in pre-symptomatic infants who are up to six weeks of age at time of first dose to determine if treatment before symptoms begin would prevent or delay the onset of SMA symptoms. An interim analysis of NURTURE showed that infants treated for up to one year with SPINRAZA achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. Three infants experienced adverse events considered possibly related to SPINRAZA, all of which resolved. In addition, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study and no new safety concerns have been identified. NURTURE is currently active and enrolling. All studies are being conducted on a global scale.

About SMA1-5

Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.

Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.

Currently, there is no approved treatment for SMA.

To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.

About SPINRAZA (nusinersen)

SPINRAZA is an investigational, potentially disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of SMA that was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics. SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is designed to alter the splicing of SMN2, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of fully functional SMN protein.7

ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has the potential to increase the amount of functional SMN protein in infants and children with SMA.

Both the U.S. and EU have granted SPINRAZA Orphan Drug status. Additionally, both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies have granted special status to SPINRAZA, including Fast Track Designation and Priority Review in the U.S. and Accelerated Assessment in the EU.

Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA in August 2016.

Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals acknowledge support from the following organizations for SPINRAZA: Cure SMA, Muscular Dystrophy Association, and SMA Foundation, intellectual property licensed from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and the University of Massachusetts Medical School.

The analysis found that children receiving SPINRAZA experienced a highly statistically significant improvement in motor function compared to those who did not receive treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile in the study.  This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161107005392/en/  “These results, along with our successful trial in infantile-onset SMA, reinforce the potential of SPINRAZA to benefit a broad range of SMA patients,” said Michael Ehlers, M.D., Ph.D., executive vice president, head of Research and Development at Biogen. “We will make regulators around the globe aware of this data and will continue working closely with them to bring SPINRAZA to families affected by SMA as quickly as possible.”  Biogen is preparing for the potential launch of SPINRAZA in the U.S. possibly as early as the end of 2016 or the first quarter of 2017.  Results From the CHERISH Interim Analysis  CHERISH is a fifteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 126 non-ambulatory patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2), including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms at greater than 6 months and an age of 2 to 12 years at screening.  Results from the primary endpoint of the pre-specified interim analysis demonstrated a difference of 5.9 points (p= 0.0000002) at 15 months between the treatment (n=84) and sham-controlled (n=42) study arms, as measured by the Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded (HFMSE). From baseline to 15 months of treatment, patients who received SPINRAZA achieved a mean improvement of 4.0 points in the HFMSE, while patients who were not on treatment declined by a mean of 1.9 points. The HFMSE is a reliable and validated tool specifically designed to assess motor function in children with SMA, and a change of three points or greater in the HFMSE has previously been identified as clinically meaningful. Data from the other endpoints analyzed were consistently in favor of children who received treatment. SPINRAZA demonstrated a favorable safety profile. The majority of the adverse events were considered to be either related to SMA disease, common events in the general population, or events related to the lumbar puncture procedure. No patients discontinued the study.  With the positive interim analysis, the CHERISH study will be stopped and participants will be able to transition into the SHINE open-label extension study to receive SPINRAZA. Full study results will be presented at future medical congresses.  “These data further validate the potential of SPINRAZA as a treatment for patients with SMA,” said B. Lynne Parshall, chief operating officer of Ionis Pharmaceuticals. “We are grateful to all the families and clinicians who have participated in all of the SPINRAZA studies. Without their commitment and support, this program would not have been able to progress so quickly.”  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently accepted the company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for SPINRAZA as a treatment for SMA and communicated they plan to act early on the NDA under an expedited review. Additionally, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recently validated Biogen’s Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) in the EU. The EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) granted Accelerated Assessment status and the FDA granted Priority Review to SPINRAZA. Biogen is initiating regulatory filings in other countries in the coming months.  Biogen initiated a global expanded access program (EAP) in infantile-onset SMA earlier this year. The company will continue to explore where and when the EAP may be broadened to include patients with later-onset SMA (consistent with Type 2).  The SPINRAZA Clinical Trial Program  SPINRAZA has been studied in both presymptomatic and symptomatic patients with SMA including patients likely to develop or diagnosed with SMA Types 1, 2, and 3.  The SPINRAZA Phase 3 program is comprised of two registrational studies, ENDEAR and CHERISH. ENDEAR is a thirteen-month study investigating SPINRAZA in 122 patients with infantile-onset SMA, including patients with the onset of signs and symptoms of SMA at up to six months of age. The endpoint pre-specified for the interim analysis of the study evaluated the proportion of motor milestone responders from the motor component of the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (HINE). Given the results of the positive interim analysis, the ENDEAR study is being stopped and participants are able to transition into the SHINE open-label study, in which all patients will receive SPINRAZA.  Additionally, the SHINE open-label extension study for patients who previously participated in ENDEAR or CHERISH is open and is intended to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of SPINRAZA.  Two additional Phase 2 studies, EMBRACE and NURTURE, were designed to collect additional data on SPINRAZA. EMBRACE is studying a small subset of patients with infantile or later-onset SMA who do not meet the age and other criteria of ENDEAR or CHERISH. NURTURE is an open-label, ongoing study in pre-symptomatic infants who are up to six weeks of age at time of first dose to determine if treatment before symptoms begin would prevent or delay the onset of SMA symptoms. An interim analysis of NURTURE showed that infants treated for up to one year with SPINRAZA achieved motor milestones in timelines more consistent with normal development than what is observed in the natural history of patients with Type 1 SMA. Three infants experienced adverse events considered possibly related to SPINRAZA, all of which resolved. In addition, no infants have discontinued or withdrawn from the study and no new safety concerns have been identified. NURTURE is currently active and enrolling. All studies are being conducted on a global scale.  About SMA1-5  Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) is characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord and lower brain stem, resulting in severe and progressive muscular atrophy and weakness. Ultimately, individuals with the most severe type of SMA can become paralyzed and have difficulty performing the basic functions of life, like breathing and swallowing.  Due to a loss of, or defect in the SMN1 gene, people with SMA do not produce enough survival motor neuron (SMN) protein, which is critical for the maintenance of motor neurons. The severity of SMA correlates with the amount of SMN protein. People with Type 1 SMA, the most severe life-threatening form, produce very little SMN protein and do not achieve the ability to sit without support or live beyond 2 years without respiratory support. People with Type 2 and Type 3 produce greater amounts of SMN protein and have less severe, but still life-altering forms of SMA.  Currently, there is no approved treatment for SMA.  To support awareness and education in SMA, Biogen has launched Together in SMA in the United States. Together in SMA is a program created to provide informational materials and resources to the SMA community. Learn more at www.TogetherinSMA.com.  About SPINRAZA (nusinersen)  SPINRAZA is an investigational, potentially disease-modifying therapy for the treatment of SMA that was discovered and developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, a leader in antisense therapeutics. SPINRAZA is an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) that is designed to alter the splicing of SMN2, a gene that is nearly identical to SMN1, in order to increase production of fully functional SMN protein.7  ASOs are short synthetic strings of nucleotides designed to selectively bind to target RNA and regulate gene expression. Through use of this technology, SPINRAZA has the potential to increase the amount of functional SMN protein in infants and children with SMA.  Both the U.S. and EU have granted SPINRAZA Orphan Drug status. Additionally, both the U.S. and EU regulatory agencies have granted special status to SPINRAZA, including Fast Track Designation and Priority Review in the U.S. and Accelerated Assessment in the EU.  Biogen exercised its option to worldwide rights to SPINRAZA in August 2016.

  --Conference call to be held at 3:00 p.m., Eastern Time, today--
PARSIPPANY, N.J. &amp; CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--November 15, 2016--
  The Medicines Company (Nasdaq:MDCO) and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ALNY) today announced positive results from the analysis of Day 90
data for 497 patients, as well as analysis of preliminary Day 180 data for
189 patients, enrolled in the ORION -1 Phase 2 study of inclisiran. Data
from ORION-1 were presented today in a Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session
at the American Heart Association Scientific Sessions 2016 in New Orleans.
  Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si or ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational
GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9--a genetically validated
protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism--being developed for the
treatment of hypercholesterolemia.
  Inclisiran was generally well tolerated and no material safety issue was
observed, including no elevations of liver enzymes considered related to
study medication and no neuropathy or change in renal function. Overall
incidence of treatment emergent adverse events was 54% both in patients
randomized to placebo and in patients randomized to inclisiran, with no
differences between inclisiran doses. Injection site reactions (ISRs) with
inclisiran were infrequent (observed in 3.2% of patients), mild or moderate,
and transient - in only 2.4% of patients, the reported ISR started or was
still present 4 or more hours after dosing.
  Baseline LDL-C was approximately 130 mg/dL among 497 randomized and treated
patients. Among these patients, one 300 mg subcutaneous injection of
inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 51% at Day 60, which were
durable to Day 90 (mean 45% and up to 76%). All differences relative to
placebo in these 497 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).
  Among 189 randomized and treated patients who had been followed for 180 days
or more by the interim data cut-off date of October 25, 2016, one 300 mg
subcutaneous injection of inclisiran achieved mean LDL-C reductions of 59%
at Day 60, which were durable to Day 90 (mean 50%) and Day 180 (mean 43% and
up to 81%). Two 300 mg injections of inclisiran - one given on Day 1 and one
on Day 90 - achieved a mean LDL-C reduction of 57% at Day 120, which was
durable to Day 180 (mean 52% and up to 81%). All differences relative to
placebo in these 189 patients were statistically significant (p <0.0001).
  ""The remarkable strength and consistency of the data from ORION-1 provide
compelling support for the medical and commercial potential of inclisiran
and drive our decision to move into Phase 3 with what we believe could be a
highly-competitive and potentially transformational medicine,"" said Clive
Meanwell, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of The Medicines Company. ""We
will focus our resources on inclisiran for aggressive Phase 3 development to
ensure that this promising agent is investigated thoroughly and rapidly in
Phase 3, submitted to worldwide regulatory agencies and, if approved, made
available to millions of at-risk, often non-adherent, patients worldwide who
continue to grapple with the realities and risks of high LDL-C.""
  David Kallend, MBBS, Vice President and Global Medical Director of The
Medicines Company, added, ""These positive results from ORION-1 showed robust
and durable knockdown of LDL-C and a very encouraging safety and
tolerability profile at this stage of development. The data strengthen our
earlier findings in Phase 1 - published recently in the New England Journal
of Medicine - that an infrequent, low volume dosing regimen of 2 or 3
injections per year could constitute a highly-differentiated and competitive
treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia. Inclisiran also has the
potential to open new care approaches linking the temporal cycle of LDL-C
monitoring with counseling and administration of therapy. The ORION-1 data
have enabled us to select an optimal dose of 300 mg, and the data presage a
quick and efficient transition to Phase 3 development.""
  John J.P. Kastelein, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Medicine and Chairman of the
Department of Vascular Medicine at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) of the
University of Amsterdam, said, ""Elevated LDL-C remains a major risk factor
for coronary artery disease, and new therapies are needed for patients who
are refractory or intolerant to current approaches for management of their
LDL-C levels. PCSK9 therapies have now emerged as a new class of drugs for
treatment of hypercholesterolemia, and I believe that these agents have the
potential to make a meaningful difference for patients. ORION-1 strengthens
prior data with inclisiran, especially the degree and durability of LDL-C
lowering effects. If the safety and efficacy of this novel investigational
PCSK9 synthesis inhibitor can be confirmed in Phase 3 studies to support
approval, it may offer an important treatment option for patients,
physicians, and payers.""
  John Maraganore, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Alnylam, added, ""We are
delighted with these data from the ORION development program for inclisiran
and thankful for the progress made by investigators and our partner, The
Medicines Company. We are very excited to see the rapid progression of the
program worldwide and are confident that our RNAi platform provides the
opportunity to create new medicines for important diseases such as
hypercholesterolemia, which have major unmet medical needs.""

  About ORION-1
  ORION-1 is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized Phase 2 study of
single or multiple subcutaneous injections of inclisiran in a total of 501
patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) or ASCVD-risk
equivalents (e.g., diabetes and familial hypercholesterolemia) and elevated
LDL-C despite maximum tolerated doses of LDL-C lowering therapies. The study
compares the effect of different doses of inclisiran and evaluates the
potential for an infrequent dosing regimen. The primary endpoint of the
study is the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline at Day 180.
  About Inclisiran
  Inclisiran (formerly known as PCSK9si or ALN-PCSsc) is an investigational
GalNAc-conjugated RNAi therapeutic targeting PCSK9 -- a genetically
validated protein regulator of LDL receptor metabolism -- being developed
for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In contrast to anti-PCSK9
monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to PCSK9 in blood, inclisiran is a
first-in-class investigational medicine that acts by turning off PCSK9
synthesis in the liver.
  In a previous, single-ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3
+/- 2.0% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1% with mean maximum lowering of
up to 59.3 +/- 5.0%. At Day 180, a single dose of inclisiran was associated
with an up to 53% reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent
lowering of 47.0% in the 300 mg dose cohort.
  In a previous multiple ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with
maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5
+/- 1.6% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0% with mean maximum lowering of
up to 64.4 +/- 5.4%.
  Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple
subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or
discontinuations due to adverse events.
  The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in
the advancement of inclisiran per the companies' agreement formed in early
2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain
pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines
Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase 2
forward, as well as potential commercialization.

In a previous, single-ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 88.7% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 82.3 +/- 2.0% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 78.1% with mean maximum lowering of up to 59.3 +/- 5.0%. At Day 180, a single dose of inclisiran was associated with an up to 53% reduction in LDL-C, with a least squares mean percent lowering of 47.0% in the 300 mg dose cohort.   In a previous multiple ascending dose study, inclisiran was associated with maximal PCSK9 knockdown of 94.4% with mean maximum knockdown of up to 88.5 +/- 1.6% and maximal LDL-C reduction of 83.0% with mean maximum lowering of up to 64.4 +/- 5.4%.   Inclisiran was generally well tolerated following single and multiple subcutaneous dose administration, with no serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.   The Medicines Company and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are collaborating in the advancement of inclisiran per the companies' agreement formed in early 2013. Under the terms of the agreement, Alnylam completed certain pre-clinical studies and the Phase 1 clinical study, with The Medicines Company leading and funding the development of inclisiran from Phase 2 forward, as well as potential commercialization.   About The Medicines Company   The Medicines Company is a biopharmaceutical company driven by an overriding purpose--to save lives, alleviate suffering and contribute to the economics of healthcare. The Company's mission is to create transformational solutions to address the most pressing healthcare needs facing patients, physicians and providers in three critical therapeutic areas: serious infectious disease care, cardiovascular care and surgery and perioperative care. The Company is headquartered in Parsippany, New Jersey, with global innovation centers in California and Switzerland.   The Medicines Company Forward Looking Statements ",,10%

  Canada NewsWire
  INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 23, 2016
  INDIANAPOLIS, Nov. 23, 2016 /CNW/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today
announced that solanezumab did not meet the primary endpoint in the
EXPEDITION3 clinical trial, a phase 3 study of solanezumab in people with
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
  Patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a statistically
significant slowing in cognitive decline compared to patients treated with
placebo (p=.095), as measured by the ADAS-Cog(14) (Alzheimer's Disease
Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale).
  While the study results, including many secondary clinical endpoints,
directionally favored solanezumab, the magnitudes of treatment differences
were small. There were no new safety signals identified in the study. Lilly
will not pursue regulatory submissions for solanezumab for the treatment of
mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease.
  ""The results of the solanezumab EXPEDITION3 trial were not what we had hoped
for and we are disappointed for the millions of people waiting for a
potential disease-modifying treatment for Alzheimer's disease,"" said John C.
Lechleiter, Ph.D., chairman, president and chief executive officer, Lilly.
""We will evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for
solanezumab and our other Alzheimer's pipeline assets.""
  Lilly will work with investigators to appropriately conclude the open-label
extensions for EXPEDITION, EXPEDITION2 and EXPEDITION3. The next steps for
the remaining elements of the solanezumab development program have not yet
been determined.
  ""Lilly is grateful for the dedication of the patients, their families, and
the clinical investigators who participated in this study,"" said Jan
Lundberg, Ph.D., executive vice president of science and technology and
president of Lilly Research Laboratories. ""Lilly remains committed to
Alzheimer's research as we have been for nearly 30 years, and our portfolio
includes many other promising approaches.""
  Lilly will present further findings from the study at the Clinical Trials on
Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting on Thursday, December 8(th) at 9:15 p.m.
ET. The presentation will be shared live via webcast from the meeting. To

  ""Lilly has strong growth prospects without solanezumab,"" said David A.
Ricks, Lilly's incoming chief executive officer and president of Lilly
Bio-Medicines. ""Driven by new product launches, we continue to expect to
grow average annual revenue by at least 5 percent between 2015 and 2020.
Over that time frame, we also expect to increase our margins and provide
annual dividend increases to our shareholders.""
  The EXPEDITION3 study outcome is expected to result in a fourth-quarter
charge of approximately $150 million (pre-tax), or approximately $0.09 per
share (after-tax). The company will provide updated 2016 financial guidance
and announce its 2017 financial guidance on December 15, 2016 and will also
conduct a conference call with the investment community and media at 9:00

  About Solanezumab
  Solanezumab is Lilly's phase 3 monoclonal antibody being studied as a
potential therapy for people with mild cognitive impairment due to
Alzheimer's disease (EXPEDITION-PRO), preclinical Alzheimer's disease
(Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's ""A4""), and Dominantly
Inherited Alzheimer's Disease (""DIAN"").
  About EXPEDITION3
  EXPEDITION3 is a multinational, phase 3 trial of solanezumab in more than
2,100 patients diagnosed with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The
study includes an 18-month placebo-controlled period followed by an open
label extension. Enrollment was completed in 2015 and the last patient visit
for the placebo-controlled period occurred in October 2016. EXPEDITION3 is
the first phase 3 trial to evaluate only people with mild dementia due to
Alzheimer's disease.
  About Alzheimer's Disease
  Alzheimer's disease is a fatal illness that is believed to start with
changes in the brain that may begin 20 years or more before symptoms
appear.(1) Those changes cause a progressive decline in memory and other
aspects of cognition that eventually lead to dementia.
  Dementia due to Alzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia,
accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases.(1) There are currently an
estimated 47 million people living with dementia worldwide.(2) The number of
people affected by dementia is expected to be nearly 75 million in 2030 and
131 million in 2050.(2) Estimates vary, but experts suggest that as many as
5.4 million Americans may have Alzheimer's disease.(1)

Phase 3 Studies Showing Significant Early Response and First-Line Efficacy
  HASBROUCK HEIGHTS, N.J., Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nymox
Pharmaceutical Corporation (NASDAQ:NYMX) is pleased to announce that new
Phase 3 prospective randomized clinical trial results have confirmed that
patients who received fexapotide as their initial treatment for BPH
(prostate enlargement) had superior efficacy results as early as 10 days
compared to control patients who received placebo or who had prior history
of other BPH medical treatments. These new Phase 3 results indicate that
fexapotide in these trials was highly efficacious for first-line treatment
of BPH.
  These findings are from analysis of the Company's extensive U.S. Phase 3
trials NX02-0017, NX02-0018, NX02-0020 and NX02-0022 including long-term
follow-ups that were undertaken from 2009 to 2016. These important results
come on top of many other positive results including successfully reaching
long-term primary efficacy endpoints, that have previously been reported.
The present prospective randomized trial results are new findings. 390
treatment naive patients with no past treatments for BPH had improvements
greater than previously treated BPH patients as early as 10 days
post-treatment (p<.02) and at one month (p<.04), 3 months (p<.001), six
months (p<.001), one year (p<.01) and at long-term (3.5 years) follow-up
(p<.003). The levels of mean change from baseline pre-treatment ranged from
6.49 to 8.88 points improvement in the AUA BPH Symptom Score. These
previously untreated patients who received a single injection of fexapotide
2.5 mg also had statistically significant superior improvements compared to
patients who received placebo treatments, as early as 10 days post-treatment
(p<.001) and at several time points also including the long-term (3.5 years)
follow-up extension (p<.001).
  Dr. Paul Averback, CEO of Nymox said, ""It is important to have now
demonstrated for Nymox's fexapotide, both 1. that it leads to an early onset
of clinically noticeable improvement; and 2. that it works well long-term as
a first-line therapeutic for men who have not tried other treatments before.
There is a major unmet need for a convenient, safe and efficacious treatment
for countless men worldwide with BPH who are unhappy with their symptoms and
who may be unhappy with their available choices.""
  Traditional BPH treatments have very undesirable side effects, particularly
causing frequent problems with ejaculation and overall sexual function, as
well as many other limiting side effects. Pills for BPH usually need to be
taken permanently to remain effective and surgical treatments for BPH often
produce permanent distortions of ejaculation as well as other risks. Middle
aged and elderly male patients often need a safer and more effective way to
manage these extremely common life problems.
  Nymox's lead drug fexapotide has been in development for over a decade and
has been tested by expert clinical trial investigative teams in over 70
distinguished clinical trial centers throughout the US, and has been found
after 7 years of prospective placebo controlled double blind studies of
treatment of 995 U.S. men with prostate enlargement to not only show
clinically meaningful and durable relief of BPH symptoms, but also to show a
major reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer, compared to placebo and
compared to the known and expected normal incidence of the disease. The same
clinical program conducted at the same highly regarded treatment centers
under rigorous trial scrutiny and performed strictly at arms-length by top
teams of clinical investigators across the country, has also shown in a
long-term blinded placebo crossover group study an 82-95% reduction in the
number of these patients who required surgery after they received crossover
fexapotide in the trial, as compared to patients who did not receive
fexapotide but instead received crossover conventional approved BPH
treatments (p<.0001). The aim of the crossover study was to determine the
clinical benefit fexapotide can provide to men who initially were double
blind randomized to and received placebo, remained blinded as to their
placebo treatment, and who subsequently required additional medical and/or
surgical treatment. In that study long-term outcomes were determined in 391
patients who were given double blind placebo injections, followed by
crossover to other treatments at the patients' discretion. The numbers of
blinded placebo patients who subsequently received surgical treatment during
the next 2-3 years for their BPH symptoms were then prospectively analyzed.
  For the earlier fexapotide Phase 3 long-term cancer incidence analysis, the
men in the study received fexapotide or placebo for the treatment of their
prostate enlargement (BPH) symptoms. All men were thoroughly evaluated at
expert urological testing investigational centers to exclude any prostate
cancer prior to qualifying for enrollment in the studies. The participants
were followed for up to 7 years (median of 5 years) after treatment. The
study analyzed all cases of prostate cancer that were subsequently
diagnosed. The expected rate of new prostate cancer in the U.S. general male
population in this age group is in the 5-20% range after 7 years. In the BPH
population in published large trials of drugs for the prevention of prostate
cancer, the incidence of new prostate cancer cases after 4-7 years has been
reported in major studies to be 20-25%. The data analysis from the Nymox
fexapotide study showed a statistically significant and very low incidence
of 1.3% for prostate cancer in this comparable fexapotide treated BPH
population. By comparison, for example in a population of patients with
erectile dysfunction treated with PDE5 inhibitor drugs after 4 years the
rate of subsequent prostate cancer was 19.5% (and 22.7% in controls) as
recently reported in a large U.S. study published in the Journal of Urology
(Volume 196; 3, 2016). The quoted study was in a population of middle aged
and elderly men without prostate cancer, similar to the Nymox study
population.
  Nymox recently announced (October 11, 2016) positive long-term results in
344 patients who were given a single repeat fexapotide treatment after
initial blinded treatment with fexapotide or placebo. Patients were followed
for 2 to 6.5 years (mean 4.2 years) after initial treatment and showed
long-term statistically significant symptomatic improvement (mean
improvement of 6.5 points in the AUA BPH Symptom Score) compared to Phase 3
patients who received placebo alone (p<.001). Repeat injection was found to
be safe with no significant drug related toxicities or side effects found in
the study.
  Nymox has completed the execution of seven Phase 3 U.S. BPH clinical
protocols, including 2 prospective randomized multicenter single injection
double blind clinical trials; 2 U.S. repeat injection clinical trials; and 3
U.S. blinded long-term clinical trial extension studies. In addition, a
number of Phase 3 safety and clinical pharmacology studies and analyses have
been completed.

These new Phase 3 results indicate that fexapotide in these trials was highly efficacious for first-line treatment of BPH.   These findings are from analysis of the Company's extensive U.S. Phase 3 trials NX02-0017, NX02-0018, NX02-0020 and NX02-0022 including long-term follow-ups that were undertaken from 2009 to 2016. These important results come on top of many other positive results including successfully reaching long-term primary efficacy endpoints, that have previously been reported. The present prospective randomized trial results are new findings. 390 treatment naive patients with no past treatments for BPH had improvements greater than previously treated BPH patients as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.02) and at one month (p<.04), 3 months (p<.001), six months (p<.001), one year (p<.01) and at long-term (3.5 years) follow-up (p<.003). The levels of mean change from baseline pre-treatment ranged from 6.49 to 8.88 points improvement in the AUA BPH Symptom Score. These previously untreated patients who received a single injection of fexapotide 2.5 mg also had statistically significant superior improvements compared to patients who received placebo treatments, as early as 10 days post-treatment (p<.001) and at several time points also including the long-term (3.5 years) follow-up extension (p<.001).   Dr. Paul Averback, CEO of Nymox said, ""It is important to have now demonstrated for Nymox's fexapotide, both 1. that it leads to an early onset of clinically noticeable improvement; and 2. that it works well long-term as a first-line therapeutic for men who have not tried other treatments before. There is a major unmet need for a convenient, safe and efficacious treatment for countless men worldwide with BPH who are unhappy with their symptoms and who may be unhappy with their available choices.""   Traditional BPH treatments have very undesirable side effects, particularly causing frequent problems with ejaculation and overall sexual function, as well as many other limiting side effects. Pills for BPH usually need to be taken permanently to remain effective and surgical treatments for BPH often produce permanent distortions of ejaculation as well as other risks. Middle aged and elderly male patients often need a safer and more effective way to manage these extremely common life problems.   Nymox's lead drug fexapotide has been in development for over a decade and has been tested by expert clinical trial investigative teams in over 70 distinguished clinical trial centers throughout the US, and has been found after 7 years of prospective placebo controlled double blind studies of treatment of 995 U.S. men with prostate enlargement to not only show clinically meaningful and durable relief of BPH symptoms, but also to show a major reduction in the incidence of prostate cancer, compared to placebo and compared to the known and expected normal incidence of the disease. The same clinical program conducted at the same highly regarded treatment centers under rigorous trial scrutiny and performed strictly at arms-length by top teams of clinical investigators across the country, has also shown in a long-term blinded placebo crossover group study an 82-95% reduction in the number of these patients who required surgery after they received crossover fexapotide in the trial, as compared to patients who did not receive fexapotide but instead received crossover conventional approved BPH treatments (p<.0001). The aim of the crossover study was to determine the clinical benefit fexapotide can provide to men who initially were double blind randomized to and received placebo, remained blinded as to their placebo treatment, and who subsequently required additional medical and/or surgical treatment. In that study long-term outcomes were determined in 391 patients who were given double blind placebo injections, followed by crossover to other treatments at the patients' discretion. The numbers of blinded placebo patients who subsequently received surgical treatment during the next 2-3 years for their BPH symptoms were then prospectively analyzed.   For the earlier fexapotide Phase 3 long-term cancer incidence analysis, the men in the study received fexapotide or placebo for the treatment of their prostate enlargement (BPH) symptoms. All men were thoroughly evaluated at expert urological testing investigational centers to exclude any prostate cancer prior to qualifying for enrollment in the studies. The participants were followed for up to 7 years (median of 5 years) after treatment. The study analyzed all cases of prostate cancer that were subsequently diagnosed.

  TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 29, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --  VBL Therapeutics
(NASDAQ:VBLT), today announced top-line results from its exploratory Phase 2
study of VB-111 (ofranergene obadenovec) in patients with advanced,
differentiated thyroid cancer. As previously announced, this trial met its
primary endpoint, which was defined as 25% progression-free survival at 6
months (PFS-6), in heavily-pretreated patients with late-stage disease. A
dose-dependent response was seen, with 35% of patients reaching PFS-6 in the
therapeutic dose cohort, versus 25% in a low-dose cohort. Given this
positive clinical response, the Company continued to follow patients for
overall survival (OS) data, which was not a primary endpoint. Although the
trial included a small number of patients and was not powered to show OS
differences, the new data show a dose-response and evidence of an overall
survival benefit in the cohort of patients treated with multiple therapeutic
doses of VB-111, compared to patients who received a single low dose of
VB-111 (mOS 761 days versus 469 days; p=0.096).  Only one patient remained
alive in the low-dose cohort, compared to a tail of about 50% in the high
dose group.

  ""The appearance of dose-dependent superior overall survival provides
encouragement, especially given that this trial enrolled patients with
late-stage disease whose tumors were resistant to multiple lines of previous
therapies,"" said Keith C. Bible, MD, PhD, Professor of Oncology, Division of
Medical Oncology, Department of Oncology, and Endocrine Malignancies Disease
Oriented Group, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, and Primary Investigator for this
trial.
  ""This is the third indication in which we have seen profound clinical
responses and evidence of an overall survival benefit with VB-111,"" said
Dror Harats, MD, Chief Executive Officer of VBL Therapeutics. ""Following our
Phase 2 OS data in recurrent GBM and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, this
trial, which evaluated VB-111 as monotherapy, reinforces the potential of
VB-111 and its unique mechanism of action, for multiple solid tumor
indications. We are continuing to focus on completion of our clinical
program, and potentially commercialization, of VB-111 for rGBM, and to
advance our ovarian cancer clinical program.  Based on the current data, we
may expand our program to additional indications, such as thyroid cancer,
either independently in the future, or earlier in collaboration with a
strategic partner,"" added Prof. Harats.
  The open-label dose-escalating study enrolled patients with advanced,
recently-progressive, differentiated thyroid cancer that is unresponsive to
radioactive iodine, in two cohorts. The majority of patients had tumors
which had failed on several therapeutic lines, including tyrosine kinase
inhibitors, prior to enrollment. In the first cohort twelve patients
received a single intravenous infusion of VB-111 at a low dose of 3X10(12)
viral particles (VPs). The second cohort included seventeen patients, who
received VB-111 at a therapeutic dose of 10(13) VPs every two months until
disease progression. The company previously reported that 35% of patients in
the therapeutic dose cohort (n=17) met the primary endpoint of 6-month
progression-free survival using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), compared to 25% of patients in the low dose cohort. PFS at 12
months was 25% in the VB-111 high dose cohort, versus 0% in the low dose
cohort.  Continued follow-up now indicates further survival benefit for the
multiple-dose therapeutic cohort, with median OS of 761 versus 469 in the
low-dose cohort (p=0.096).  VB-111 was well-tolerated in this study, with no
signs of clinically significant safety issues.
  About Thyroid Cancer
  Thyroid cancer occurs in the thyroid gland, a hormone-producing organ at the
base of the neck that regulates heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature
and weight. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are an
estimated 535,000 people currently living with thyroid cancer in the United
States, with an estimated 60,000 new cases each year and an estimated 1,850
annual deaths as a result of the disease. The type of treatment depends on
the cancer cell type, tumor size and severity of the disease. First-line
treatment is surgical removal of the thyroid gland, and is recommended for
most patients. Treatment with radioactive iodine after surgery to destroy
any remaining thyroid tissue may be recommended for more advanced disease.
If radioactive iodine is ineffective, other treatments are prescribed, such
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and systemic chemotherapy. However, if such
treatments are unsuccessful, the therapeutic options for patients are
currently very limited.
  About VBL
  Vascular Biogenics Ltd., operating as VBL Therapeutics, is a clinical stage
biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and
commercialization of first-in-class treatments for cancer. The Company's
lead oncology product candidate, ofranergene obadenovec (VB-111), is a
first-in-class, targeted anti-cancer gene-therapy agent that is positioned
to treat a wide range of solid tumors. It is conveniently administered as an
IV infusion once every two months. It has been observed to be well-tolerated
in >200 cancer patients and we have observed its efficacy signals in an ""all
comers"" Phase 1 trial as well as in three tumor-specific Phase 2 studies.
Ofranergene obadenovec is currently being studied in a Phase 3 pivotal trial
for recurrent Glioblastoma, conducted under an FDA Special Protocol
Assessment (SPA).
  About Ofranergene Obadenovec (VB-111)
  ofranergene obadenovec is a unique biologic agent that uses a dual mechanism
to target solid tumors. Based on a non-integrating, non-replicating, Adeno 5
vector, ofranergene obadenovec utilizes VBL's proprietary Vascular Targeting
System (VTS(TM)) to target the tumor vasculature for cancer therapy. Unlike
anti-VEGF or TKIs, ofranergene obadenovec does not aim to block a specific
pro-angiogenic pathway; instead, it uses an angiogenesis-specific sensor
(VBL's PPE-1-3x proprietary promoter) to specifically induce cell death in
angiogenic endothelial cells in the tumor milieu. This mechanism retains
activity regardless of baseline tumor mutations or the identity of the
pro-angiogenic factors secreted by the tumor and shows efficacy even after
failure of prior treatment with other anti-angiogenics. Moreover,
ofranergene obadenovec induces specific anti-tumor immune response, which is
accompanied by recruitment of CD8 T-cells and apoptosis of tumor cells.
  Ofranergene obadenovec completed a Phase 2 study in rGBM, which showed a
statistically significant improvement in overall survival in patients
treated with ofranergene obadenovec through progression, compared to either
patients treated with ofranergene obadenovec followed by bevacizumab alone,
or to historical bevacizumab data. In a Phase 2 trial for recurrent
platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, ofranergene obadenovec demonstrated a
statistically significant increase in overall survival and 60% durable
response rate (as measured by reduction in CA-125), approximately 2x the
historical response with bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.
In a Phase 2 study in recurrent, iodine-resistant differentiated thyroid
cancer, ofranergene obadenovec met the primary endpoint and provided
evidence of disease stabilization and a positive safety profile. Ofranergene
obadenovec has received Fast Track Designation for recurrent glioblastoma in
the U.S. and orphan drug status for glioblastoma in both the U.S. and EU.

CERC,11/29/16,Biotech,Clinical,MarketWired,Cerecor Reports Top-Line Data from CERC-301 Phase 2 Study for Major Depressive Disorder,S.IW CERC .NASDAQ MHHE.IW .MEDICAL PBBI.IW .PHARMA,"BALTIMORE, MD--(Marketwired - November 29, 2016) - Cerecor Inc. (NASDAQ: CERC), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders, today announced top-line clinical results from its major depressive disorder (MDD) Phase 2 clinical trial (Clin301-203) of adjunctive treatment of CERC-301, an oral, NR2B specific, NMDA receptor antagonist. Overall, the trial failed to demonstrate efficacy on the primary endpoint for mean improvement in Bech-6, a subset of the Hamilton Depression Scale (HDRS-17), averaged over days 2 and 4 post dose. However, the study showed signals for the CERC-301 20 mg dose group at Day 2, at pre-specified secondary endpoints, indicating a potentially clinically-meaningful effect, though not statistically significant, on the Bech-6 and HDRS-17.

The trial was a 3-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential parallel comparison design (SPCD) study of intermittent doses of adjunctive CERC-301 (12 mg or 20 mg) or placebo in the treatment of subjects with MDD who have not adequately responded to antidepressant therapy, either a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitor (SNRI).

The study randomized 115 subjects. The study was conducted in two sequential one week periods. Placebo non-responders in Period 1 were re-randomized to either study drug or placebo in Period 2. Subjects received treatment at the beginning of each period. The results of Periods 1 and 2 were averaged. The study included a one-week follow-up.

In this SPCD designed study, the mean improvement from baseline on the Bech-6 scale averaged over Days 2 and 4 post treatment for Period 1 was 3.82 for placebo, 2.50 for the 12 mg dose and 4.11 for the 20 mg dose, and for Period 2 was 2.86 for placebo, 1.64 for the 12mg dose and 3.38 for the 20 mg dose. The weighted average for the difference in placebo and drug improvement (placebo minus drug) was +1.45 and -0.04 for 12 mg and 20 mg CERC-301, respectively.

In a pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the Bech-6 at Day 2 for Period 1 was 3.59 for placebo, 4.71 for 20 mg; and for Period 2, 2.30 for placebo and 3.52 for 20 mg. In another pre-specified analysis of the mean improvement from baseline on the HDRS-17 at Day 2 for Period 1 was 6.24 for placebo and 9.71 for 20 mg; and for Period 2, 3.60 for placebo and 5.38 for 20 mg.

Significant improvement was not observed on the other secondary endpoints evaluated to date.

Consistent with previous trials, CERC-301 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs reported and no discontinuations due to AEs. The most commonly reported adverse events in the study were increased blood pressure, dizziness, somnolence and paresthesia.

""While the trial failed to achieve the primary efficacy endpoint, we note that these results suggest a potentially clinically meaningful treatment effect in the 20 mg dose at Day 2,"" added Ronald Marcus, M.D., Chief Medical Officer and Head of Regulatory Affairs at Cerecor.

""Based on this well conducted and controlled clinical trial, we continue to believe that adjunctive CERC-301 may have the potential to reduce depressive symptoms very rapidly with the added patient convenience of oral dosing,"" said Dr. Uli Hacksell, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerecor. ""We intend to more fully assess the results from this trial as we continue to receive the remaining data sets over the coming weeks and will announce planned next steps for CERC-301 at a later time.""

""From a clinician's perspective, these data warrant additional clinical testing to fully explore the potential for this compound to treat MDD,"" said Dr. Maurizio Fava, Director, Division of Clinical Research of the Massachusetts General Hospital Research Institute & Executive Vice Chair, Department of Psychiatry. ""I would note that a minimum of 2 points of improvement on the HDRS-17 scale compared to placebo is considered by many, and noted in MDD studies, to be clinically meaningful.""

Cerecor intends to present additional data from this trial at scientific meetings in 2017.

About CERC-301
CERC-301 is an oral, NR2B selective, NMDA receptor antagonist being developed as an adjunctive treatment of MDD. CERC-301 may have the potential to be a first-in-class medication that may significantly reduce depressive symptoms in a matter of days. Based on the signal of potential clinical meaningfulness shown in Phase 2 testing, we are currently assessing future development.

About Cerecor
Cerecor is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative drug candidates to make a difference in the lives of patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. In addition to CERC-301, Cerecor is currently pursuing the development of CERC-501, which is also a clinical Phase 2-stage product candidate, as well as two earlier stage programs.

CERC-501 is a potent and selective kappa opioid receptor antagonist that is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial for smoking cessation that is expected to provide top-line data in December 2016. In addition to Cerecor's Phase 2 trial, three externally-funded clinical trials are being conducted to evaluate the use of CERC-501 in treating depressive symptoms, stress related smoking relapse and cocaine addiction. One study is being conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Mental Health, the second is a collaboration between Cerecor and Yale University with funding from the National Institutes of Health and the third is being conducted at Rockefeller University Hospital with funding from a private foundation. Cerecor intends to begin Phase 2 testing of CERC-501 for the treatment of adjunctive MDD.

ARWR,11/29/16,Biotech,Clinical,BusinessWire,Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals Focuses Resources on Subcutaneous and Extra-Hepatic RNAi Therapeutics,S.BW ARWR BIOTC.BW .BIOTECH CA.BW .CA CLINT.BW CONFC.BW .CC GENET.BW HEALT.BW .HEALTH INFDI.BW ONCOL.BW PHARM.BW .PHARMA WEBCS.BW .NASDAQ,"November 29, 2016 21:03:00 UTC
- Conference Call and Webcast Today at 4:30 p.m. EST

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARWR) today announced a strategic redeployment of resources to support the development of RNAi therapeutics that utilize the company’s new proprietary subcutaneous (subQ) and extra-hepatic delivery systems. Arrowhead will discontinue development of clinical stage drug candidates ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT, which utilize the DPCiv™, or EX1, delivery vehicle. The company is hosting a conference call at 4:30 p.m. EST to discuss this decision.

Arrowhead remains committed to finding therapeutic options for patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD). The company intends to advance to the clinic two previously unannounced HBV and AATD programs using our subQ platform. Arrowhead has learned a great deal during prior HBV and AAT studies that will help drive the subQ programs efficiently.

Existing preclinical subQ and extra-hepatic programs such as ARC-LPA and ARC-AMG1, which are partnered with Amgen, ARC-F12, ARC-HIF2, and other unannounced programs are not affected by this decision.

Because of the discontinuation of its existing clinical programs, the company is reducing its workforce by approximately 30%, while maintaining full resourcing necessary to support current and potential future partner-based programs and Arrowhead’s burgeoning pipeline. This more streamlined structure should enable the company to continue to develop its programs rapidly, and is intended to extend its cash runway into 2019.

The decision to discontinue development of EX1-containing programs was based primarily on two factors. First, during ongoing discussions with regulatory agencies and outside experts, it became apparent that there would be substantial delays in all clinical programs that utilize EX1, while the company further explored the cause of deaths in a non-clinical toxicology study in non-human primates. Second, Arrowhead has made substantial advances in RNA chemistry and targeting resulting in large potency gains for subQ administered and extra-hepatic RNAi-based development programs. In preclinical studies with the subQ platform, the company has obtained depth and duration of target gene knockdown approaching that of intravenously administered EX1-containing candidates, at lower doses and with good safety margins.

The company believes it is prudent to focus its development resources entirely on its subQ and extra-hepatic pipeline, which includes programs in HBV, AAT, Factor 12, HIF-2alpha, and other unannounced programs. In addition to its own pipeline, Arrowhead is also focused on providing full resources to support its partnership with Amgen and potential future partnerships for its subQ and extra-hepatic delivery systems.

The tolerability of ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT in human clinical trials appeared to be favorable, and in the company’s view, supported advancing the programs. EX1-containing candidates have been administered over 800 times in more than 300 human study subjects and patients and have been generally well tolerated, with a small minority (6%) of infusions being associated with infusion reactions. In addition, across the ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT clinical programs, laboratory values have not been deemed indicative of drug induced organ toxicity.

In addition, each candidate was highly active against its respective target. For example, data presented earlier this month at The Liver Meeting® show that ARC-AAT achieved 90% knockdown of serum AAT, which is believed to be near full suppression of liver production of the protein, in a Phase 1 clinical study. For ARC-520, it was previously reported that reductions in surface antigen (HBsAg) of almost 99%, or 2 logs, were achieved after a single dose. In subsequent multiple dose studies, for which data have not yet been reported, reductions of almost 3 logs were observed, with several patients being tracked that appear poised to possibly seroclear HBsAg, representing potential function cures.

However, due to likely regulatory considerations, as of this announcement all patient recruitment for ARC-520, ARC-521, and ARC-AAT has been halted and dosing discontinued. The company will work together with investigators and clinical sites to ensure a smooth transition of study closure and patient medical care.

Society of Urological Oncology Annual Meeting
  DURHAM, N.C., Nov. 30, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heat Biologics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:HTBX), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies
that are designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer,
announced that it presented topline data from its 94-patient Phase II trial
evaluating HS-410 (vesigenurtacel-L) in combination with standard of care,
Bacillus Calmette-Gu&#233;rin (BCG), or as a monotherapy, for the treatment
of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, at the Society of Urologic Oncology
Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.
  In the poster, ""Top-Line Results from Vesigenurtacel-L (HS-410) in
Combination with BCG from a Randomized, Blinded Phase 2 Trial in Patients
with Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (NMIBC),"" researchers reported that
there were encouraging signs of anti-tumor activity as HS-410 generated a
robust antigen-specific immune response to multiple tumor-associated
peptides in treated patients, while there were no immune responses of this
type in the placebo.  However, these responses did not translate into
clinical outcomes, and there was no statistically significant difference in
the primary endpoint (proportion of recurrence-free survival at one year)
between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. To better assess the
durability of the positive immunological responses, and in keeping with
clinical trial guidance recently issued by International Bladder Cancer
Group (""IBCG"")(1) recommending a 2-year study duration for NMIBC trials,
Heat will continue to monitor all patients enrolled in the study for an
additional 12 months. At that time, Heat will make a final determination
whether to progress its bladder cancer program into a Phase 3 trial.
  ""The ability of HS-410 to prime T-cells suggests a strong signal that the
vaccine is having an impact, as well as an opportunity to improve responses,
in this challenging disease,"" said study principal investigator, Gary
Steinberg, M.D., The Bruce and Beth White Family Professor of Surgery and
Director of Urologic Oncology at the University of Chicago. ""Historically,
NMIBC has been very difficult to treat, with BCG being the only approved
therapy in the past 40 years. We were surprised to see that all arms of this
trial performed much better than historical control, which is a testament to
improvements in standard of care, and validates our choice to run a
controlled clinical trial. We look forward to continuing to monitor patients
in this trial, per IBCG recommendations. and would like to thank the many
patients and their families for the commitment to this trial and advancement
of the treatment of bladder cancer.""
  ""We were pleased to see a robust antigen-specific immune response,
reinforcing our earlier clinical data,"" Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat Biologics,
commented. ""Even though we did not achieve our desired clinical outcomes, we
are encouraged by the results and believe this, and other combination
therapies, have the potential to improve long-term outcomes. In particular,
Heat's ComPACT technology, combining a therapeutic vaccine with an immune
co-stimulator in a single product, was designed to substantially improve
immune response durability. We are actively pursuing new programs to
complement our existing platforms, which we expect to announce in early
2017. Moreover, we look forward to examining the additional top-line data
that will be reported next week for our combination trial of HS-110 in with
Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo(R) (nivolumab) in lung cancer.""
  ""HS-410 stimulated antigen-specific immune responses to multiple
tumor-associated peptides,"" commented Taylor Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., Chief
Scientific Officer. ""The kinetics of these responses indicate efficient
priming of CD8+ T cells, consistent with results seen in other Heat
Biologics clinical trials. Remaining analyses are in progress to inform
future development of other agents and/or combinations aimed at improving
immune response durability. Further understanding of the secondary and
exploratory endpoints will advise future development steps.""

  About Heat Biologics, Inc.
  Heat Biologics, Inc. (Nasdaq:HTBX) is an immuno-oncology company developing
novel therapies that are designed to activate a patient's immune system
against cancer utilizing an engineered form of gp96, a protein that
activates the immune system when cells die. Heat's highly specific T
cell-stimulating therapeutic vaccine platform technologies, ImPACT and
ComPACT, form the basis of its product candidates. These platforms, in
combination with other therapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are
designed to address three distinct, but synergistic mechanisms of action:
robust activation of CD8+ ""killer"" T cells (one of the human immune system's
most potent weapons against cancer); reversal of tumor-induced immune
suppression; and T cell co-stimulation to further enhance patients' immune
response.  Currently, Heat is conducting a Phase 2 trial with HS-410
(vesigenurtacel-L) in patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer
(NMIBC) and a Phase 1b trial with HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) in combination
with an anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor to treat patients with non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC).
  Heat's wholly-owned subsidiary, Zolovax, Inc., is developing therapeutic and
preventative vaccines to treat infectious diseases based on Heat's gp96
vaccine technology, with a current focus on the development of a Zika
vaccine, in conjunction with the University of Miami. The Zolovax patent
portfolio also includes gp96 vaccines targeting Zika and West Nile virus,
Dengue and yellow fever among others.

However, these responses did not translate into clinical outcomes, and there was no statistically significant difference in the primary endpoint (proportion of recurrence-free survival at one year) between the vaccine and placebo arms of the trial. To better assess the durability of the positive immunological responses, and in keeping with clinical trial guidance recently issued by International Bladder Cancer Group (""IBCG"")(1) recommending a 2-year study duration for NMIBC trials, Heat will continue to monitor all patients enrolled in the study for an additional 12 months. At that time, Heat will make a final determination whether to progress its bladder cancer program into a Phase 3 trial.   ""The ability of HS-410 to prime T-cells suggests a strong signal that the vaccine is having an impact, as well as an opportunity to improve responses, in this challenging disease,"" said study principal investigator, Gary Steinberg, M.D., The Bruce and Beth White Family Professor of Surgery and Director of Urologic Oncology at the University of Chicago. ""Historically, NMIBC has been very difficult to treat, with BCG being the only approved therapy in the past 40 years. We were surprised to see that all arms of this trial performed much better than historical control, which is a testament to improvements in standard of care, and validates our choice to run a controlled clinical trial. We look forward to continuing to monitor patients in this trial, per IBCG recommendations. and would like to thank the many patients and their families for the commitment to this trial and advancement of the treatment of bladder cancer.""   ""We were pleased to see a robust antigen-specific immune response, reinforcing our earlier clinical data,"" Jeff Wolf, CEO of Heat Biologics, commented. ""Even though we did not achieve our desired clinical outcomes, we are encouraged by the results and believe this, and other combination therapies, have the potential to improve long-term outcomes. In particular, Heat's ComPACT technology, combining a therapeutic vaccine with an immune co-stimulator in a single product, was designed to substantially improve immune response durability. We are actively pursuing new programs to complement our existing platforms, which we expect to announce in early 2017. Moreover, we look forward to examining the additional top-line data that will be reported next week for our combination trial of HS-110 in with Bristol-Myers Squibb's Opdivo(R) (nivolumab) in lung cancer.""   ""HS-410 stimulated antigen-specific immune responses to multiple tumor-associated peptides,"" commented Taylor Schreiber, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer. ""The kinetics of these responses indicate efficient priming of CD8+ T cells, consistent with results seen in other Heat Biologics clinical trials. Remaining analyses are in progress to inform future development of other agents and/or combinations aimed at improving immune response durability. Further understanding of the secondary and exploratory endpoints will advise future development steps.""   ""We conducted a cost-efficient trial and will continue to gather important data with minimal ongoing costs,"" Mr. Wolf added.

Session: Plenary Session 7

The open-label Phase 1 CRB-401 study (NCT02658929) is investigating the administration of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells in patients with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The primary endpoint of the study is incidence of adverse events (AEs) and abnormal laboratory test results, including dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The study also seeks to assess disease-specific response criteria including: complete response (CR), very good partial response (VGPR), and partial response (PR) according to the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Uniform Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The study also seeks to determine the recommended dose for further clinical trials. Patients on study were heavily pre-treated, with a median of six prior therapies (range: 5 - 13). As of the November 18th, 2016 data cut-off, 11 patients had been enrolled and dosed in four dose cohorts: 5.0 x 107, 15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 and 80 x 107 CAR+ T cells. All 11 dosed patients were evaluable for safety, and the first nine patients (5.0 x 107, 15.0 x 107, 45.0 x 107 dose cohorts) have undergone their first multiple myeloma tumor restaging and were evaluable for efficacy. This study is currently enrolling patients at seven sites in the U.S., with an anticipated total enrollment of 50 patients.

Patients received a conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, followed by an infusion of bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR T cells. The CAR T cells were produced from each patient’s own blood cells, which were modified using a lentiviral vector encoding the anti-BCMA CAR.

Avastin(R) Combination in Relapsed Renal Cell Carcinoma
  CRLX101 plus Avastin Does Not Show Improvement Compared to Standard of Care
in this Setting
  Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 pm EDT
WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 17, 2016--
  Cerulean Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing
nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced top-line results from
the Company's Phase 2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of its lead
candidate, CRLX101, in combination with Avastin(R) (bevacizumab) in the
treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).
  The trial was conducted at 43 sites in the US and South Korea, and enrolled
115 patients with RCC who progressed through two or three prior lines of
therapy. Patients were randomized to receive CRLX101 in combination with
Avastin or investigator's choice standard of care (SOC) therapy. SOC agents
included axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib,
and temsirolimus. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS)
in the clear cell population (n=102) assessed by independent radiological
review. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of
response and overall survival.
  The study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median PFS
and objective response rate for the CRLX101 combination compared to SOC.
Median PFS was 3.7 months for the CRLX101 combination compared with a median
PFS of 3.9 months for SOC (hazard ratio: 1.25, p=0.822). The 95% confidence
interval for PFS for the CRLX101 combination was 2.0 months to 4.3 months
and for SOC was 2.2 months to 5.4 months. Objective response rate by
independent radiological review for patients who received the CRLX101
combination was 5% (2/42) compared to 14% (6/43) for SOC (p=0.836). The
CRLX101 and Avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and
the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with
that observed in previous studies. The full data set from the trial are
expected to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.

  ""We are disappointed with this outcome and will undertake a thorough
analysis of the data to understand why CRLX101 plus Avastin underperformed
compared to the results we saw in an earlier investigator-sponsored trial,""
said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Cerulean. ""This outcome did not support our hypothesis that targeting
hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in combination with VEGF inhibitor in RCC, a
HIF-overexpressing tumor type, would be beneficial, so we will not pursue
HIF as a target going forward. We will continue to focus on the potent
topoisomerase 1 inhibition of CRLX101's payload, camptothecin, in
topoisomerase 1-sensitive tumors. Our combinations with weekly paclitaxel
and LYNPARZA(TM) (olaparib) are examples of ongoing trials that leverage
CRLX101's topoisomerase 1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapies and
DNA damage repair agents.""

  About CRLX101
  CRLX101 is a nanoparticle-drug conjugate (NDC) designed to concentrate in
tumors and slowly release its anti-cancer payload, camptothecin, inside
tumor cells. CRLX101 inhibits topoisomerase 1 (topo 1), which is involved in
cellular replication. CRLX101 has shown activity in multiple tumor types,
both as monotherapy and in combination with other cancer treatments. CRLX101
is in Phase 2 clinical development and has been dosed in more than 400
patients. The U.S. FDA has granted CRLX101 Orphan Drug designation for the
treatment of ovarian cancer, Fast Track designation in combination with
paclitaxel for platinum-resistant ovarian carcinoma, fallopian tube or
primary peritoneal cancer, and Fast Track designation in combination with
Avastin(R) in metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
  About Cerulean Pharma
  The Cerulean team is committed to improving treatment for people living with
cancer. We apply our Dynamic Tumor Targeting(TM) Platform to create a
portfolio of NDCs designed to selectively attack tumor cells, reduce
toxicity by sparing the body's normal cells, and enable therapeutic
combinations. Our first platform-generated NDC clinical candidate, CRLX101,
is in multiple clinical trials in combination with other cancer treatments,
all of which aim to unlock the power of combination therapy. Our second
platform-generated NDC clinical candidate, CRLX301, is in Phase 2a clinical
development. For more information, please visit www.ceruleanrx.com.
  About Cerulean's Dynamic Tumor Targeting(TM) Platform
  Cerulean's Dynamic Tumor Targeting Platform creates NDCs that are designed
to provide safer and more effective cancer treatments. We believe our NDCs
concentrate their anti-cancer payloads inside tumors while sparing normal
tissue because they are small enough to pass through the ""leaky"" vasculature
present in tumors but are too large to pass through the wall of healthy
blood vessels. Once inside tumors, our NDCs enter tumor cells where they
slowly release anti-cancer payloads from within the tumor cells.
","Cerulean Announces Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of CRLX101 and Avastin(R) Combination in Relapsed Renal Cell Carcinoma   CRLX101 plus Avastin Does Not Show Improvement Compared to Standard of Care in this Setting   Company to Host Conference Call Today at 4:30 pm EDT WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 17, 2016--   Cerulean Pharma Inc. (NASDAQ:CERU), a clinical-stage company developing nanoparticle-drug conjugates (NDCs), today announced top-line results from the Company's Phase 2, randomized, multi-center clinical trial of its lead candidate, CRLX101, in combination with Avastin(R) (bevacizumab) in the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).   The trial was conducted at 43 sites in the US and South Korea, and enrolled 115 patients with RCC who progressed through two or three prior lines of therapy. Patients were randomized to receive CRLX101 in combination with Avastin or investigator's choice standard of care (SOC) therapy. SOC agents included axitinib, bevacizumab, everolimus, pazopanib, sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus. The primary endpoint was progression free survival (PFS) in the clear cell population (n=102) assessed by independent radiological review. Secondary endpoints included overall response rate, duration of response and overall survival.   The study demonstrated no statistically significant difference in median PFS and objective response rate for the CRLX101 combination compared to SOC. Median PFS was 3.7 months for the CRLX101 combination compared with a median PFS of 3.9 months for SOC (hazard ratio: 1.25, p=0.822). The 95% confidence interval for PFS for the CRLX101 combination was 2.0 months to 4.3 months and for SOC was 2.2 months to 5.4 months. Objective response rate by independent radiological review for patients who received the CRLX101 combination was 5% (2/42) compared to 14% (6/43) for SOC (p=0.836). The CRLX101 and Avastin combination appeared to be safe and well-tolerated and the safety and tolerability profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in previous studies. The full data set from the trial are expected to be submitted for presentation at an upcoming medical conference.    ""We are disappointed with this outcome and will undertake a thorough analysis of the data to understand why CRLX101 plus Avastin underperformed compared to the results we saw in an earlier investigator-sponsored trial,"" said Christopher D. T. Guiffre, President and Chief Executive Officer of Cerulean. ""This outcome did not support our hypothesis that targeting hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) in combination with VEGF inhibitor in RCC, a HIF-overexpressing tumor type, would be beneficial, so we will not pursue HIF as a target going forward. We will continue to focus on the potent topoisomerase 1 inhibition of CRLX101's payload, camptothecin, in topoisomerase 1-sensitive tumors. Our combinations with weekly paclitaxel and LYNPARZA(TM) (olaparib) are examples of ongoing trials that leverage CRLX101's topoisomerase 1 inhibition in combination with chemotherapies and DNA damage repair agents.""   Conference Call Details   Cerulean will host a conference call today at 4:30 pm Eastern Daylight Time to discuss the results and provide an update on the CRLX101 development program.

CRENEZUMAB
   -- Crenezumab higher dose in CREAD Phase 3 Alzheimer's trial supported by
      exposure-response model

   -- Phase 1b dose-escalation study results support 60mg/kg dose in CREAD
      Phase 3
  Lausanne, Switzerland, December 9, 2016 - AC Immune SA (NASDAQ: ACIU), a
Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on
neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that its partner Genentech,
member of Roche group, has presented important data to support the unique
binding and increased dosing of its Alzheimer's therapy on crenezumab, an
anti-Abeta antibody. These data were presented at the 9(th) Clinical Trials
on Alzheimer's disease Conference (CTAD) in San Diego, USA: they were from a
Phase 1b safety study and an exposure-response model to evaluate the best
dose of crenezumab for the treatment of people with Alzheimer's disease. The
model predicts, relative to the Phase 2 trials, an improved outcome of the
CREAD Phase 3 clinical trial in patients with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer by
using the higher dose of 60mg/kg of crenezumab.
  Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, commented: ""We are impressed by the
drug-disease model, as well as the safety data of the Phase 1b study which
further support the higher dose of crenezumab in the Phase III trial
targeting prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer patients.""
  About the crenezumab drug-disease progression model
  Genentech has developed a comprehensive drug-disease progression model to
simulate the Phase 3 clinical trial and estimate the likelihood of achieving
relative reduction in disease progression in patients treated with different
doses of crenezumab, in different patient populations. The drug-disease
model adequately described the historical longitudinal decline in ADAS-Cog
12([1]) and CDR-SB([2]) in mild to moderate AD patients of crenezumab in
Phase 2 studies (ABBY/BLAZE).
  The clinical trial simulations using the drug-disease model predict a
meaningful response of crenezumab in patients with mild AD at a dose of
60mg/kg IV every 4 weeks, as measured by CDR-SB and ADAS-Cog 12. This dose
of 60mg/kg IV was selected by Genentech for the Phase 3 CREAD trial, which
started recruitment of patients in Q1 2016.
  About the Phase 1b study results
  Genentech presented the results of the first two cohorts of the Phase 1b
crenezumab dose escalation study (NCT02353598) in 52 patients with
mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. No dose-limiting toxicities were
observed at 30, 45 and 60mg/kg doses of crenezumab. No events of Amyloid
Related Imaging Abnormality-Edema (ARIA-E) were observed in the Phase 1b
study and only a few patients (6 of 52) showed asymptomatic Amyloid Related
Imaging Abnormality-Hemsiderin(ARIA-H) which did not result in treatment
discontinuation. The pharmacokinetic profile of crenezumab is dose
proportional up to the 60mg/kg dose and is consistent with historical data.
The serum concentrations at this dose are four fold higher than in the
15mg/kg IV every four weeks dose used in the Phase 2 trials. These safety
and pharmacokinetic data of the Phase 1b dose escalation study support the
continued treatment of patients with crenezumab at a higher dose of 60mg/kg.

  About Crenezumab
  Crenezumab was discovered by AC Immune using its SupraAntigen technology
platform and out-licensed to Genentech in 2006 as a potential therapy for
Alzheimer's disease.  Crenezumab is a fully humanized IgG4 monoclonal
antibody that binds all forms of misfolded Abeta proteins, but especially to
Abeta oligomers, to prevent and break up Abeta aggregation and promote Abeta
disaggregation. The IgG4 subclass has reduced the effector function,
allowing microglia to clear Abeta from the brain while minimizing an
inflammatory response.
  Genentech is currently evaluating the clinical efficacy and safety of
crenezumab in a Phase 3 clinical trial, CREAD, in 750 participants with
prodromal or mild Alzheimer's disease, which started in Q1 2016 and is
expected to read out in 2020. In addition crenezumab was chosen by an
international panel of experts, including the US National Institutes of
Health, for use in a first-ever prevention trial in Alzheimer's disease in a
large extended family in Colombia (API ADAD) in 2012.
  About Alzheimer's disease
  It is becoming increasingly clear that Alzheimer's disease develops because
of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long
period of time. Two proteins - Tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta) - are recognized
as major hallmarks of neurodegeneration: tangles and other abnormal forms of
Tau protein accumulate inside the brain cells and spread between cells,
while plaques and oligomers formed by beta-amyloid occur outside the brain
cells of people with AD.
  AD is one of the biggest burdens of society with a dramatic and growing
worldwide incidence rate of one new case every three seconds, or 9.9 million
new cases of dementia each year. Since the incidence and prevalence of AD
increase with age, the number of patients will grow significantly as society
ages. Worldwide in 2015 there are 46.8 million people living with dementia
and by 2050 it is expected that global patient numbers will triple to 131.5
million. It is estimated that the annual societal and economic cost of
dementia has risen from US$ 604 billion in 2010 to US$ 818 billion in 2015.
In the US, AD is now the 6th leading cause of death across all ages and is
the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older.

SGYP,12/9/16,Biotech,Clinical,BusinessWire,Synergy Pharmaceuticals Announces Positive Results in First Phase 3 Trial of Plecanatide in Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C),S.BW SGYP BIOTC.BW .BIOTECH CLINT.BW FDA.BW .FDA HEALT.BW .HEALTH NY.BW .NY PHARM.BW .PHARMA PRODU.BW .PRODUCT .NASDAQ,"Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ:SGYP) today announced positive top-line results from the first of two pivotal phase 3 clinical trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide, an investigational once-daily orally-administered compound, in 1,135 adult patients with irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C).

Preliminary analysis of the data indicates that both plecanatide 3 mg and 6 mg doses met the study’s primary endpoint and showed statistical significance in the percentage of patients who were Overall Responders compared to placebo during the 12-week treatment period (21.5% in 3 mg and 24.0% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 14.2% in placebo; p=0.009 for 3 mg and p<0.001 for 6 mg). An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks.

The most common adverse event was diarrhea which occurred in 3.2% of patients in 3 mg and 3.7% of patients in 6 mg dose groups compared to 1.3% of placebo-treated patients.

“We are very pleased with these results,” said Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D., Chairman and CEO of Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. “These data reinforce our strong belief that plecanatide may represent an important new treatment option for the millions of patients currently suffering from IBS-C. We look forward to the results of our second phase 3 IBS-C trial with plecanatide later this month.”

Four patients in the trial (0.4%) experienced serious adverse events but there was no imbalance across treatment groups in either incidences or individual serious adverse events. Overall, the rates of withdrawal from treatment because of an adverse event were low (1.9% in 3 mg and 1.8% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo) and discontinuations due to diarrhea were infrequent (0.8% in 3 mg and 1.6% in 6 mg dose groups compared to 0 in placebo).

Additionally, plecanatide is under review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date is January 29, 2017. Pending approval in the CIC indication, the company plans to file a New Drug Application Supplement with Clinical Data (sNDA) for plecanatide in IBS-C in Q1 2017.

The Plecanatide Phase 3 IBS-C Program

Design

The plecanatide phase 3 IBS-C program includes two randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of plecanatide treatment (3 mg and 6 mg doses), taken as a tablet once-a-day in patients with IBS-C. Both trials included a two-week pre-treatment baseline period, a 12-week treatment period, and a two-week post-treatment follow-up period. The phase 3 IBS-C program was designed to support regulatory submission in the U.S.

The first phase 3 IBS-C trial was conducted in North America and assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).

Primary Endpoint

The primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. The Overall Responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for U.S. approval in IBS-C.

Patient Population

Patients were selected using Rome 3 criteria for IBS-C. Patients with IBS-C are defined by Rome III Criteria as having a history of constipation and abdominal pain for at least 6 months, including hard or lumpy stools for 25% or more of defecations, loose or watery stools for 25% or less of defecations, and abdominal pain or discomfort for 3 days or more per month for the last 3 months.

About Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, complex condition subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). It is estimated that the prevalence of IBS-C in the U.S. adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, though this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of IBS. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.

About Plecanatide

Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-sensitive manner targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.","Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The phase 3 IBS-C program was designed to support regulatory submission in the U.S.  The first phase 3 IBS-C trial was conducted in North America and assessed 1,135 patients (28.2% males and 71.8% females) that were randomly assigned to take 3 mg or 6 mg plecanatide or placebo once-a-day during the 12-week treatment period (377 patients in the 3 mg dose group, 379 patients in the 6 mg dose group and 379 patients in the placebo group).  Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint for both trials is the percentage of patients who are Overall Responders (%) during the 12-week treatment period. An Overall Responder, as defined by the FDA, is a patient who fulfills both ≥ 30% reduction in worst abdominal pain and an increase of ≥ 1 complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM) from baseline, in the same week, for at least 50% of the 12 treatment weeks. The Overall Responder endpoint is the current regulatory endpoint required for U.S. approval in IBS-C.  Patient Population  Patients were selected using Rome 3 criteria for IBS-C. Patients with IBS-C are defined by Rome III Criteria as having a history of constipation and abdominal pain for at least 6 months, including hard or lumpy stools for 25% or more of defecations, loose or watery stools for 25% or less of defecations, and abdominal pain or discomfort for 3 days or more per month for the last 3 months.  About Irritable Bowel Syndrome with Constipation (IBS-C)  Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, complex condition subtyped by the predominant stool form: constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed (IBS-M). It is estimated that the prevalence of IBS-C in the U.S. adult population is approximately 4 to 5 percent, though this number may vary as patients often fluctuate between the three subtypes of IBS. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort associated with two or more of the following: improvement with defecation, onset associated with a change in frequency of stool, or onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool.  About Plecanatide  Plecanatide is a peptide made up of 16 amino acids and, with the exception of a single amino acid substitution, it is identical to uroguanylin. Plecanatide is the first investigational drug designed to replicate the function of uroguanylin, a naturally occurring and endogenous human GI peptide which acts in a pH-sensitive manner targeting GC-C receptors primarily in the proximal small intestine. Plecanatide stimulates fluid secretion and promotes stool consistency necessary to support normal bowel function.",,20%

Results
  Reports Positive Data on Primary Endpoint with Positive Safety Data
  Overall Survival Compares Favorably with Single-Agent Nivolumab
  Management to host a call on Thursday, December 8(th) , at 8:30 a.m. ET
  DURHAM, N.C., Dec. 06, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heat Biologics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:HTBX), a leader in the development of gp96-based immunotherapies
designed to activate a patient's immune system to fight cancer, reported
topline response and survival results in the ongoing Phase 1b study
evaluating HS-110, in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's anti-PD-1
checkpoint inhibitor, nivolumab (Opdivo(R)), for the treatment of non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), at the International Association for the Study of
Lung Cancer Annual Meeting in Vienna, Austria.
  In an oral presentation, principal investigator, Daniel Morgensztern, MD,
Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of Thoracic Oncology,
Washington University School of Medicine, reported that one-year results
from the first eight trial patients showed that the HS-110/nivolumab
combination was well-tolerated, with a safety profile consistent with single
agent nivolumab. There were no additional toxicities seen in
HS-110/nivolumab combination compared to existing data on single agent
nivolumab alone. HS-110 generated a robust antigen-specific immune response
in several patients, consistent with the mechanism of action seen in other
HS-110 trials.  Additionally, the patients who responded best to the
combination therapy (immune responders) had longer overall survival and
better objective response rate (ORR) than the non-immune responders, even
though they had the same baseline immune function.
  Immune responders in the study saw a 50% ORR, while non-immune responders
saw a 0% ORR. This is important, as checkpoint inhibitors have been shown,
independently, to be much more effective in tumors with pre-existing, high
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). As such, there now exists an acute
need to address the large proportion of non-responders with low-TIL tumors.
  Moreover, the immune responders had a better median overall survival (OS)
than non-immune responders. The one-year OS is currently 50% for the
responders, and 25% for the non-responders. Finally, immune responders also
saw a better median OS at 12.7 months, than non-immune responders, who saw a
median OS of 7.1 months.  Researchers concluded that immune response may
correlate with clinical efficacy and that HS-110 may have synergistic
activity with immune checkpoint inhibitors.
  ""We are encouraged by the data generated in the trial,"" said Dr.
Morgensztern. ""We were impressed by the ability of HS-110 to activate a CD8+
T cell immune response. The HS-110/nivolumab combination is worth continued
exploration in the treatment of lung cancer, as the HS-110 mechanism of
action is potentially synergistic with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors.""
  ""We've continued to see ELISPOT analysis correlate with clinical efficacy
with HS-110 in NSCLC, an encouraging trend also observed in other trials
with HS-110,"" said Taylor Schreiber, MD, PhD, Heat's Chief Scientific
Officer. ""We are seeing trends between TIL status and TIL increases after
treatment among these patients, which may speak to the ability of HS-110 to
convert ""cold"" tumors to ""hot"" tumors to increase the effectiveness of PD-1
checkpoint therapy in lung cancer.""
  ""These new data are further confirmation of the ability of our ImPACT
platform, which has been administered to over 200 patients in 4 clinical
studies, to generate a robust antigen-specific immune response, an important
component of immunotherapy,"" said Jeff Wolf, Heat's CEO.  ""The future of
immuno-oncology lies in combining synergistic modalities to create more
effective treatments. At Heat, we are actively pursuing opportunities to
combine our ImPACT and ComPACT platforms with checkpoint inhibitors, and
other promising immunotherapies to improve patient outcomes.""

Study in Mild-to-Moderate Alzheimer's Disease Patients
  Data presentation at CTAD 2016
  NEW YORK, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Anavex Life Sciences Corp.
(""Anavex"" or the ""Company"") (Nasdaq:AVXL) today announced a positive 57-week
update from its Phase 2a study in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
patients for ANAVEX 2-73, which targets cellular homeostasis. The study met
both primary and secondary endpoints.
  At 57 weeks, Alzheimer's patients taking a daily oral dose between 10mg and
50mg, ANAVEX 2-73 was well tolerated. There were no clinically significant
treatment-related adverse events and no serious adverse events.
  Published AD studies confirmed substantial declines of cognitive (MMSE) and
functional (ADCS-ADL) measures as well as Cogstate and EEG/ERP over 12 month
in similar AD populations. Pre-specified exploratory analyses of the current
study included the cognitive (MMSE) and the functional (ADCS-ADL) as well as
Cogstate, HAM-D and EEG/ERP changes from baseline.
  Specifically, in comparison to historical control from a pooled placebo arm
cohort study conducted by the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study Group in
mild-to-moderate AD patients of comparable ages and MMSE baselines, over 12
month the ANAVEX 2-73 data shows a calculated treatment benefit of 1.8
points on the MMSE scale (p<0.016) and a calculated treatment benefit of 4
points on the ADCS-ADL score (p<0.019). Furthermore, the correlation was
positive with all measured scores (MMSE, ADCS-ADL, Cogstate, HAM-D and
EEG/ERP).
  George Perry, PhD, Dean and Professor at the University of Texas at San
Antonio and Editor-in Chief of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease,
commented, ""In addition to the very encouraging results, which point to the
therapeutic potential of targeting cellular homeostasis in a complex CNS
disease like Alzheimer's, this trial has been intelligently designed as a
highly informative study, looking unprejudiced at all potential
relationships and hence allowing to learn from all correlations of the now
available pool of data, in order to execute subsequent trials with much more
relevant information at hand.""
  Despite non-optimized dosing of ANAVEX 2-73 throughout the 12-month study,
continued significant improvements from baseline of cognitive, functional
and behavioral scores in a group of patients were observed, respectively.
This data will be analyzed using refined mathematical modeling methods in
conjunction with the detailed pharmacokinetic (PK) information.
  ""Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that causes
problems with memory, thinking and behavior. Currently available treatments
cannot stop Alzheimer's from progressing; they can only temporarily slow the
worsening of dementia symptoms,"" said Christopher U. Missling, PhD,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Anavex. ""We believe this data gives
us a solid foundation from which to continue the next phase of rationally
designed clinical trials. Anavex is grateful for the dedication of the
patients, their families and the clinical investigators who participated in
this study.""
  The Company is presenting findings from the study at the Clinical Trials on
Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) meeting on Saturday, December 10th at 8:45 a.m.
PT in the oral communication session. The presentation will be available in
the publications section of the Anavex website.
  The Company will also conduct a conference call with the investment
community in conjunction with the upcoming financial year-end 2016 report.
  About the ANAVEX 2-73 Phase 2a Study
  The multicenter Phase 2a clinical trial of ANAVEX 2-73 consists of two parts
and a total of 32 mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's patients. PART A is a simple
randomized, open-label, two-period, cross-over between oral (30mg/50mg) and
IV (3mg/5mg) administration, adaptive trial lasting up to 5 weeks for each
patient. PART B is an open-label extension for an additional 52 weeks.
Initially planned for 26 weeks, PART B was extended to 52 weeks as a result
of requests from patients and caregivers.
  The primary endpoint of the Phase 2a trial is to establish safety,
tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ANAVEX 2-73, which had
shown potential in preclinical studies to prevent, halt and/or reverse the
course of the disease. Secondary endpoints include dose response,
bioavailability, and exploratory cognitive as well as functional measures
using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and evaluation of Alzheimer's
Disease Co-operative Study -- Activities of Daily Living Inventory
(ADCS-ADL), as well as Cogstate test battery and EEG/ERP.
  Additional information regarding the ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial is
available from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials
database at www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 07, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Voyager Therapeutics,
Inc. (NASDAQ:VYGR), a clinical-stage gene therapy company developing
life-changing treatments for severe diseases of the central nervous system
(CNS), today announced positive results from the ongoing Phase 1b trial of
VY-AADC01 at six and twelve months of follow-up in patients with advanced
Parkinson's disease.  The interim data from Cohorts 1 and 2 of this trial
demonstrated that accurate MRI-guided delivery of escalating doses of
VY-AADC01 were well tolerated and resulted in increased coverage of the
putamen, increased AADC enzyme activity, enhanced response to levodopa, and
dose-related, clinically meaningful improvements in various measures of
patients' motor function.  This was especially evident at the higher dose in
Cohort 2 with improved UPDRS off medication and on medication scores, and
corresponding improvements in patient-reported diary hours, suggesting
higher peak effects and a longer duration of action of levodopa.  These
effects were maintained and in some patients improved at 12 months of
follow-up.
  ""At 12 months in Cohort 2, treatment with VY-AADC01 resulted in a 14-point,
or 44%, improvement in UPDRS-III off medication, a 9-point, or 55%
improvement in UPDRS-III on medication, and a 2.2 hour, or 48%, decrease in
diary off-time from baseline,"" said Bernard Ravina, M.D., M.S., vice
president of clinical development at Voyager Therapeutics. ""Very
importantly, these improvements in motor function occurred with a
substantial 34% reduction in daily doses of oral levodopa and related
medications at six months in Cohort 2 that was maintained at 12 months, a
magnitude that we find compelling and consistent with the mechanism of
action of VY-AADC01.  The dose-escalating portion of this trial continues
and we plan to complete Cohort 3 enrollment in early 2017, report 6-month
data from this Cohort as well as longer-term data from Cohorts 1 and 2 in
mid-2017, and present results from this trial at a medical conference in the
first half of next year.""
  About the Phase 1b Trial
  In advanced Parkinson's disease, the putamen is depleted of dopamine and of
the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) that is responsible
for converting levodopa to dopamine.  VY-AADC01 is Voyager's gene therapy
vector that contains the gene that encodes the AADC enzyme. The Phase 1b,
open-label trial includes up to 20 patients with advanced Parkinson's
disease and disabling motor fluctuations, treated with a single
administration of VY-AADC01.  The primary objective of the trial is to
assess the safety and surgical coverage of ascending doses of VY-AADC01 in
the putamen, a region of the brain associated with motor function in
Parkinson's disease.  The secondary objectives of the trial include the
assessment of AADC expression and activity in the putamen measured by
positron emission tomography (PET) using [(18) F] fluorodopa (or (18)
F-DOPA).  In addition, changes in motor responses to levodopa are measured
by a controlled intravenous infusion of levodopa and by measuring daily
requirements for levodopa and related medications. Other secondary
objectives include assessment of motor function as measured by the Unified
Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and a patient-completed (Hauser)
diary.
  The UPDRS is a standard clinical rating scale for Parkinson's disease. Part
III of this scale measures motor function by physician examination. The
UPDRS is conducted when patients are taking their Parkinson's disease
medications (referred to as ""on"" medication) and when patients are not
taking their Parkinson's disease medications (referred to as ""off""
medication).  In the patient-completed diary, patients record their motor
response over the course of several days as on-time, or time when they have
good mobility with or without non-troublesome dyskinesia, off-time when they
have poor mobility, and on-time with troublesome dyskinesia when they have
uncontrolled movements.
  Biomarker and Clinical Results Summary
  Today's interim results include data from all 10 patients treated in Cohorts
1 and 2 at six months (five patients in each Cohort), and where indicated,
data from five patients in Cohort 1 and three patients in Cohort 2 who have
reached 12 months of follow-up.  Patients in Cohorts 1 and 2 received a
single administration of VY-AADC01 at a total dose of up to 7.5&#215;10(11)
vector genomes (vg) and 1.5&#215;10(12) vg, respectively.  Patients enrolled
in Cohorts 1 and 2 were on average 58 years of age with a Parkinson's
disease diagnosis for an average of 10 years.  Patients were candidates for
surgical intervention due to disabling motor complications despite treatment
with optimal anti-Parkinsonian medication.  At baseline, the average UPDRS
III off medication score was 37.2 and 35.8, and the average patient diary
off-time was 4.9 and 4.2 hours, for Cohort 1 and 2, respectively. Patients'
average amount of Parkinson's disease medications at baseline was 1,468 mg
per day for Cohort 1 and 1,636 mg per day for Cohort 2. The results below
are reported as mean changes from baseline to six months, or 12 months where
indicated.
  Putamen Coverage and Biomarker Data
   -- The use of real-time, intra-operative MRI-guided delivery and increasing

      infusion volumes resulted in 21% coverage of the volume of the putamen
      with VY-AADC01 in Cohort 1 and 34% coverage in Cohort 2.

   -- VY-AADC01 treatment resulted in a 13% increase in putaminal AADC enzyme
      activity in Cohort 1 and a 56% increase in putaminal AADC enzyme
activity
      in Cohort 2 at six months relative to baseline as measured by 18F-DOPA
      PET scans.

   -- Patients reduced their daily oral dose of levodopa and related
      medications by 14% in Cohort 1 and 34% in Cohort 2 at six months.  This
      reduction in oral medication was generally maintained at twelve months.

   -- VY-AADC01 treatment prolonged the duration and markedly increased the
      motor symptom response to levodopa measured following a controlled
      intravenous infusion of levodopa administered six months after surgery
      when compared to baseline.
  Clinical Data Summary
  Treatment with VY-AADC01 resulted in the following:
   -- 15.6-point and 17.8-point (42% and 50%) improvement (reduction) in
      UPDRS-III off medication at six months in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2,
      respectively.  These improvements were 16.4-point and 14.3-point (44%
and
      44%) for Cohorts 1 and 2, respectively, at 12 months.

   -- 9.6-point (56%) improvement (reduction) in UPDRS-III on medication in
      Cohort 2 at six months that was sustained at 12 months.  Cohort 1
      demonstrated a 1.6-point (21%) worsening (increase) at six months that
      was sustained at 12 months.

   -- 2.2 hours (20%) increase in diary on-time (with no dyskinesias or
      non-troublesome dyskinesias) in Cohort 2 at six months that further
      increased to 4.1 hours (43%) at 12 months.  Cohort 1 showed a slight
      decrease in on-time at six months of 0.3 hours (-3%) and an increase of
      1.6 hours (16%) at 12 months.

   -- 1.1 hour (27%) decrease in diary off-time in Cohort 2 at six months that

      further decreased to 2.2 hours (48%) at 12 months.  Decreases in diary
      off-time in Cohort 2 also occurred in conjunction with a reduction in
      troublesome dyskinesias.  Cohort 1 showed a decrease in diary off-time
of
      0.8 hours (16%) at six months and 1.4 hours (27%) at 12 months.
  Safety Data from Cohorts 1 and 2
  The surgical procedure was successfully completed in all 10 patients and
infusions of VY-AADC01 have been well-tolerated with no vector-related
serious adverse events (SAEs).  Nine of the 10 patients were discharged from
the hospital within one to two days following surgery.  As previously
reported, one patient experienced two SAEs; a pulmonary embolism or blood
clot in the lungs, and related heart arrhythmia or irregular heartbeat.  The
patient was treated with an anti-coagulant and symptoms associated with the
SAEs have completely resolved. Investigators determined that this was most
likely related to immobility during the surgical procedure and subsequent
formation of a blood clot, or deep vein thrombosis (DVT), in the lower
extremity.  Consequently, DVT prophylaxis was added to the surgical protocol
and no subsequent events have been observed following implementation of
these measures.
  ""Our surgical experience with VY-AADC01 and the results to date show that
MRI-guided infusions are well tolerated and substantially improve our
ability to tailor the infusions to fit the patients' anatomy and accurately
deliver vector to the putamen,"" said Paul Larson, M.D., Professor and Vice
Chair of Clinical Neurological Surgery, University of California San
Francisco, and investigator in the trial.  ""The increased surgical coverage
of the putamen is further validated by the PET data and is translating into
motor function improvement in patients with advanced stages of the disease.""

  Todd Sherer, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, The Michael J. Fox Foundation
for Parkinson's Research added, ""Levodopa has been the gold-standard
treatment for Parkinson's for decades, but it has limitations.  Enhancing a
patient's response to this therapy represents an important development for
those who suffer from the advanced stages of this disease, and we are glad
to see the continued progress of this program.""  The Michael J. Fox
Foundation funded part of the initial pioneering research for this program
in Dr. Krystof Bankiewicz's laboratory at the University of California San
Francisco.

  PR Newswire
  EDISON, N.J., Dec. 8, 2016
  EDISON, N.J., Dec. 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ContraVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CTRV), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies, today provided new
insights into the mechanism of action of its hepatitis B (HBV)-optimized
cyclophilin inhibitor CRV431, showing that it effectively blocks a critical
interaction between HBV X protein (HBx) and host cyclophilin A, with
nanomolar potency.  CRV431 is believed to be the first antiviral drug with
the potential to selectively block the HBx pathway, which is known to play
several significant roles in HBV infection including protecting infected
liver cells from immune destruction, and promoting the development of liver
cancer.
  HBx is a multifunctional viral protein known to be essential for HBV
replication and for the maintenance and progression of chronic HBV disease.
HBx is involved in the production and secretion of key viral proteins, such
as HBsAg and HBeAg. HBx further disables host factors that restrict the
production of HBV and other viral products, including covalently closed
circular DNA (cccDNA) which is key to the persistence of chronic HBV
infection. ContraVir's recent in vitro studies indicate that CRV431 blocks
the interaction between HBx and cyclophilin A, which is required for HBx to
function fully.
  Importantly, HBx is required early in the viral life cycle and works
""upstream"" of other classes of anti-HBV drugs.  CRV431 therefore could
potentially interrupt several essential pathways enabling development of a
curative combination with other HBV treatments.  CRV431 has demonstrated
synergistic activity in vitro with ContraVir's tenofovir prodrug CMX157,
currently in Phase 2 clinical trials.
  ""Identifying this exciting mechanism of action for CRV431 places ContraVir
at the very forefront of HBV research, with a compound that can effectively
target the HBx pathway,"" said James Sapirstein, CEO of ContraVir.  ""Further
development of this novel compound, and ultimately layering it on top of
CMX157 and potentially other HBV drugs, dovetails with our overall
development strategy which is focused on finding a functional cure for HBV.
The pathogenic effects of HBx are many, and we would therefore expect the
anti-HBx activity of CRV431 to be equally robust.  We will continue to work
on characterizing the activity of CRV431 and its impact on HBx and HBV
within our company, and through our peers in North America and Europe.""
  Philippe Gallay, Ph.D., Professor at The Scripps Research Institute, who
conducted the in vitro study, commented, ""HBx and its involvement in the
pathogenesis of HBV is widely supported by the scientific literature, and
its importance as a high-value drug target was highlighted at the recent
joint HBV conference hosted by the American Association of the Study of
Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the
Liver (EASL).  However, until now, we hadn't confirmed the ability of an
antiviral drug to bind to a specific ligand of HBx -- cyclophilin A.  CRV431
may therefore be unique as a small molecule drug that selectively targets
the function of HBx and thus has the potential to repress, among other
things, cccDNA transcription, which has exciting implications about its
potential to significantly inhibit HBV when used together with complementary
antivirals.  We are proud to lead this cutting edge research by continuing
to advance CRV431.""
  About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals
  ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and
commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on
developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The
Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary
mechanisms of action: CMX157, a highly potent analog of the successful
antiviral drug tenofovir currently in Phase 2a, which has demonstrated the
potential for low, once a day dosing compared to Viread(R) and decreased
systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects;
and CRV431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure
that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is
also developing Valnivudine (TM) (formerly FV-100), an orally available
nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles,
in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition to direct antiviral activity,
Valnivudine(TM) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of
debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN)
in a Phase 2 clinical study. For more information visit www.contravir.com.

""Further development of this novel compound, and ultimately layering it on top of CMX157 and potentially other HBV drugs, dovetails with our overall development strategy which is focused on finding a functional cure for HBV. The pathogenic effects of HBx are many, and we would therefore expect the anti-HBx activity of CRV431 to be equally robust.  We will continue to work on characterizing the activity of CRV431 and its impact on HBx and HBV within our company, and through our peers in North America and Europe.""   Philippe Gallay, Ph.D., Professor at The Scripps Research Institute, who conducted the in vitro study, commented, ""HBx and its involvement in the pathogenesis of HBV is widely supported by the scientific literature, and its importance as a high-value drug target was highlighted at the recent joint HBV conference hosted by the American Association of the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).  However, until now, we hadn't confirmed the ability of an antiviral drug to bind to a specific ligand of HBx -- cyclophilin A.  CRV431 may therefore be unique as a small molecule drug that selectively targets the function of HBx and thus has the potential to repress, among other things, cccDNA transcription, which has exciting implications about its potential to significantly inhibit HBV when used together with complementary antivirals.  We are proud to lead this cutting edge research by continuing to advance CRV431.""   About ContraVir Pharmaceuticals   ContraVir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The Company is developing two novel anti-HBV compounds with complementary mechanisms of action: CMX157, a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir currently in Phase 2a, which has demonstrated the potential for low, once a day dosing compared to Viread(R) and decreased systemic exposure, thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects; and CRV431, a next generation cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against HBV. ContraVir is also developing Valnivudine (TM) (formerly FV-100), an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug for the treatment of herpes zoster, or shingles, in a Phase 3 clinical trial. In addition to direct antiviral activity, Valnivudine(TM) has demonstrated the potential to reduce the incidence of debilitating shingles-associated pain known as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in a Phase 2 clinical study.

ACTIMMUNE(R) (interferon gamma-1b) in Friedreich's Ataxia
  Conference call today at 8 a.m. ET
  DUBLIN, Ireland, Dec. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Horizon Pharma plc
(NASDAQ:HZNP), a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving patients'
lives by identifying, developing, acquiring and commercializing
differentiated and accessible medicines that address unmet medical needs,
today announced that the Phase 3 trial, STEADFAST (Safety, Tolerability and
Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study),
evaluating ACTIMMUNE(R) (interferon gamma-1b) for the treatment of
Friedreich's ataxia (FA) did not meet its primary endpoint of a
statistically significant change from baseline in the modified Friedreich's
Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS--mNeuro) at 26 weeks versus treatment with
placebo.  FARS--mNeuro is an exam-based rating scale that measures disease
progression based on functional parameters such as speech, ability to
swallow, upper and lower limb coordination, gait and posture.
  In addition, the secondary endpoints did not meet statistical significance.
No new safety findings were identified on initial review of data other than
those already noted in the ACTIMMUNE prescribing information for approved
indications.  The Company, in conjunction with the independent Data Safety
Monitoring Board, the principal investigator and the Friedreich's Ataxia
Research Alliance (FARA) Collaborative Clinical Research Network (CCRN) in
FA, has determined that, based on the trial results, the FA development
program will be discontinued, including the 26-week extension study and the
long-term safety study.
  Patients participating in the ongoing extension studies should contact their
study site coordinator for further information and next steps.
  The Company will continue to work with FARA and the principal investigator
to further analyze the data to help inform future research efforts as well
as future data presentation or publication.
  ""A well-designed, rigorous study like STEADFAST would not have been possible
without the extraordinary drive of the FA community, particularly the people
who enrolled in the study, the clinical trial investigators and the
Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance,"" said Timothy P. Walbert, chairman,
president and chief executive officer, Horizon Pharma plc.  ""While the
results were not what we hoped for, this is the very reason why research and
development is important -- to find answers that may help inform future
research.""
  ""FARA's mission is to drive research to develop therapies that will treat
and cure Friedreich's ataxia and we remain passionately committed to that
mission so that one day soon patients and caregivers impacted by this
devastating disease will have effective treatment options,"" said Ronald J.
Bartek, co-founder and founding president, FARA.  ""We want to extend our
sincere appreciation to all of the patients, patient families and
investigators who were a part of this study as well as Horizon for
collaborating with us so impressively on this important research.""
  The announcement today does not impact Horizon Pharma's full-year 2016
adjusted net sales or adjusted EBITDA guidance, and the Company believes it
is well-positioned for growth in 2017 and beyond based on its existing
portfolio of medicines.  Horizon's management will host a live conference

  About STEADFAST
  Conducted by Horizon in partnership with the Friedrich's Ataxia Research
Alliance (FARA), STEADFAST or Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of ACTIMMUNE
Dose Escalation in Friedreich's Ataxia study enrolled 92 patients at four
top FA centers across the country.  The randomized, multi-center,
double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study, evaluated patients treated
with subcutaneous doses of either ACTIMMUNE or placebo three times a week
for a total of 26 weeks.
  The primary endpoint evaluated the effect of ACTIMMUNE versus placebo on the
change from baseline to Week 26 in neurological outcome as measured by the
modified Friedreich's Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS--mNeuro), a subset of the
total FARS score that measures objective components of a patient's ability
to function such as upper and lower extremity coordination.  The FARS is a
validated neurological outcome scale, in which higher scores reflect a
greater level of disability.  FARS-mNeuro was determined by experts in the
field to be the most clinically relevant instrument for assessing the
effects of treatment on FA in this particular trial.  Secondary endpoints
included observed mean change from baseline to week 26 in Activities of
Daily Living (ADL), Timed 25-foot Walk Test (T25FW), Friedreich's Ataxia
Rating Scale (FARS) scores, and other neurologic evaluations. In addition to
safety and efficacy, the STEADFAST trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic
characteristics of ACTIMMUNE in people with FA.
  About Friedreich's ataxia (FA)
  FA is a debilitating, life-shortening and degenerative neuro-muscular
disorder that affects approximately 4,000 to 6,000 people in the United
States.  Onset of symptoms can vary from five years old to adulthood, with
the childhood onset tending to be associated with a more rapid progression.
Symptoms include progressive loss of strength and coordination usually
leading to wheelchair use; diminished vision, hearing and speech; scoliosis
(curvature of the spine); increased risk of diabetes; and a life-threatening
heart condition.  Most young people diagnosed with FA require mobility aids
such as a cane, walker or wheelchair by their teens or early 20's.  There
are currently no approved treatments for FA.
  About ACTIMMUNE
  ACTIMMUNE (interferon gamma-1b) is a biologically manufactured protein
similar to one the body makes naturally to help prevent infection. ACTIMMUNE
is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use
in two rare diseases.  It is indicated for reducing the frequency and
severity of serious infections associated with Chronic Granulomatous Disease
(CGD), a genetic disorder that affects the functioning of some cells of the
immune system.  In addition, ACTIMMUNE is indicated for delaying time to
disease progression for patients with severe, malignant osteopetrosis (SMO),
a genetic disorder that affects normal bone formation.  For more
information, please see www.ACTIMMUNE.com.
  ACTIMMUNE is not indicated for FA.
  ACTIMMUNE Important Safety Information
  ACTIMMUNE is contraindicated in patients who develop or have known
hypersensitivity to interferon-gamma, E coli-derived products or any
component of the product
  ACTIMMUNE should be used with caution in patients with:
   -- pre-existing cardiac conditions, including ischemia, congestive heart
      failure or arrhythmia

   -- Seizure disorders or compromised central nervous system function; reduce

      dose or discontinue

   -- Myelosuppression, or receiving other potentially myelosuppressive
agents;
      consider dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy

   -- Severe renal insufficiency

   -- Age < 1 year
  Monitoring:
   -- Patients begun on ACTIMMUNE before age 1 year should receive monthly
      assessments of liver function.  If severe hepatic enzyme elevations
      develop, ACTIMMUNE dosage should be modified

   -- Monitor renal function regularly when administering ACTIMMUNE in
patients
      with severe renal insufficiency; accumulation of interferon gamma-1b may

      occur with repeated administration. Renal toxicity has been reported in
      patients receiving ACTIMMUNE
  Pregnancy, Lactation, and Fertility:
   -- ACTIMMUNE should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit
      outweighs the potential risk to the fetus

   -- Use of ACTIMMUNE by lactating mothers is not recommended. ACTIMMUNE or
      nursing should be discontinued dependent on the importance of the drug
to
      the mother

   -- Long-term effects of ACTIMMUNE on fertility are not known
  Drug Interactions:
   -- Concomitant use of drugs with neurotoxic, hematotoxic or cardiotoxic
      effects may increase the toxicity of interferons

   -- Avoid simultaneous administration of ACTIMMUNE with other heterologous
      serum protein or immunological preparations (e.g., vaccines)
  Adverse Reactions:
   -- The most common adverse experiences occurring with ACTIMMUNE therapy are

      ""flu-like"" symptoms such as fever, headache, chills, myalgia or fatigue,

      which may decrease in severity as treatment continues, and may be
      minimized by bedtime administration of ACTIMMUNE

   -- Acetaminophen may be used to prevent or partially alleviate the fever
and
      headache

   -- Isolated cases of acute serious hypersensitivity reactions have been
      observed in patients receiving ACTIMMUNE

   -- Reversible neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevations of AST and/or
      ALT have been observed during ACTIMMUNE therapy

   -- At doses 10 times greater than the weekly recommended dose, ACTIMMUNE
may
      exacerbate pre-existing cardiac conditions or may cause reversible
      neurological effects such as decreased mental status, gait disturbance
      and dizziness

TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NYSE MKT: TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced positive top-line results from its pivotal phase 3 Replenish Trial of TX-001HR, an investigational bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß-estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel, for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause in post-menopausal women with an intact uterus.

Figure 1. Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks 1 to 12 (Graphic: Business Wire)

The Replenish Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The doses studied were:

17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416)
17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423)
17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421)
17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424)
Placebo (n = 151)
The Replenish Trial results demonstrated:

TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint.
TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo.
TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose.
The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Agency’s (FDA) draft guidance.1
As outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the Replenish Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12 as compared to placebo.1 The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.

The results of the Replenish Trial (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy) are summarized in the below table and included multimedia.

“We are very pleased that multiple doses of TX-001HR studied in the Replenish Trial demonstrated these positive results, suggesting that, if approved, this drug product candidate is poised to address the significant demand for bio-identical hormone therapy,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert G. Finizio. “We have successfully advanced the science for post-menopausal women’s health by finding a way to effectively combine bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone. The need for a bio-identical FDA-approved combination therapy has been unanswered for decades, driving women to use unapproved drugs mixed together by independent and community pharmacies that compound these products. We believe that TX-001HR, if approved, will provide women, healthcare providers and pharmacists with a proven safe, effective and insurance reimbursed bio-identical combination product, finally answering that need. We will continue to evaluate these promising data, and look forward to submitting a New Drug Application for TX-001HR to the Food and Drug Administration as early as the third quarter of 2017.”

The trial also demonstrated a dose response favoring the higher doses of estradiol in combination with progesterone. The availability of multiple doses of TX-001HR would allow for individualized therapy to meet the needs of a diverse population of women.

The most common adverse events (>5 percent) reported on average in all the active treatment groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, breast tenderness, and upper respiratory infection. There was a very low reported incidence of adverse events of somnolence with TX-001HR, in contrast to commercially available oral progesterone where somnolence has been reported as a significant side effect. There were no unexpected safety signals.

The Replenish Trial evaluated various secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the responder analysis rate. Both TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant improvements in the secondary endpoints using these tools.

Additional efficacy and safety analyses of the Replenish Trial data are ongoing and TherapeuticsMD plans to submit the full Replenish Trial results for presentation at future scientific meetings and for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

“TX-001HR is the first bio-identical combination hormone therapy of estradiol in combination with progesterone to be evaluated in a large, well-controlled, randomized clinical trial,” said TherapeuticsMD Chief Medical Officer Sebastian Mirkin, M.D. “The Replenish Trial demonstrated for the first-time safety and robust efficacy for the treatment of hot flashes at multiple doses of TX-001HR. If approved, TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg would provide TherapeuticsMD with a complete portfolio to meet the demands of women currently taking unapproved compounded hormones for the treatment of VMS, along with the healthcare providers and pharmacies that prescribe and compound these products.”

About TX-001HR

TX-001HR is a novel combination of 17ß-estradiol and natural progesterone under investigation for treating vasomotor symptoms related to menopause. If approved by the FDA, TX-001HR would represent the first bio-identical estradiol and progesterone approved for use in a single, combined product for postmenopausal women with an intact uterus offering women an important alternative to both the available FDA-approved synthetic (non-bio-identical) hormones and the unapproved compounded bio-identical hormone products. Bio-identical refers to estradiol and progesterone that are molecularly identical to the hormones circulating naturally in the woman’s body. An estimated one to two-and-a-half million women in the U.S. are using unapproved, compounded bio-identical hormone therapies to treat vasomotor symptoms.2 Leading medical societies and the FDA advise that compounded hormone therapies may pose significant risk to women given lack of efficacy and safety data and lack of uniform manufacturing processes.

TX-001HR was developed using TherapeuticsMD’s unique SYMBODATM technology (meaning “similar to the body”), which enables partial and complete solubilization of estradiol and progesterone into medium-chain fatty acid oils often derived from coconut oil.

About Menopause and Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS)

Menopause is a natural life-stage transition for women with an average onset of 51 years. According to the United States Census Bureau, approximately 43 million women in the U.S. are of menopausal age (45-64 years).3

As the ovaries stop producing hormones, levels of circulating estrogen decrease, often causing vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as night sweats, hot flashes, and sleep disturbances. VMS affect as many as 60-80 percent of all menopausal women.

Menopausal women can benefit from hormone therapy (HT), also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which is recognized by key medical societies as the most effective treatment for relief of symptoms related to menopause.","- TX-001HR, the first bio-identical combination therapy of estradiol and progesterone evaluated in a randomized, controlled clinical trial met all co-primary efficacy and safety endpoints at multiple doses -  - TX-001HR, if approved, offers a potential new alternative for millions of post-menopausal women currently using unapproved compounded hormone therapy for the treatment of VMS -  - Conference call today at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss results -  TherapeuticsMD, Inc. (NYSE MKT: TXMD), an innovative women’s healthcare company, today announced positive top-line results from its pivotal phase 3 Replenish Trial of TX-001HR, an investigational bio-identical hormone therapy combination of 17ß-estradiol and progesterone in a single, oral softgel, for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) due to menopause in post-menopausal women with an intact uterus.  This Smart News Release features multimedia.

Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks  ...  Figure 1. Mean Change from Baseline in Weekly Frequency of Moderate to Severe Hot Flashes for Weeks 1 to 12 (Graphic: Business Wire)  The Replenish Trial evaluated four doses of TX-001HR and placebo in 1,835 post-menopausal women between 40 and 65 years old. The doses studied were:  17ß-estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 416) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg (n = 423) 17ß-estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 421) 17ß-estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg (n = 424) Placebo (n = 151) The Replenish Trial results demonstrated:  TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both achieved all four of the co-primary efficacy endpoints and the primary safety endpoint. TX-001HR estradiol 1 mg/progesterone 100 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 100 mg both demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction from baseline in both the frequency and severity of hot flashes compared to placebo. TX-001HR estradiol 0.5 mg/progesterone 50 mg and TX-001HR estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg were not statistically significant at all of the co-primary efficacy endpoints. The estradiol 0.25 mg/progesterone 50 mg dose was included in the clinical trial as a non-effective dose to meet the recommendation of the FDA guidance to identify the lowest effective dose. The incidence of consensus endometrial hyperplasia or malignancy was 0 percent across all four TX-001HR doses, meeting the recommendations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Agency’s (FDA) draft guidance.1 As outlined in the FDA guidance, the co-primary efficacy endpoints in the Replenish Trial were the change from baseline in the number and severity of hot flashes at weeks 4 and 12 as compared to placebo.1 The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of endometrial hyperplasia with up to 12 months of treatment. General safety was also evaluated.  The results of the Replenish Trial (p-values of < 0.05 meet FDA guidance and support evidence of efficacy) are summarized in the below table and included multimedia.  Replenish Trial Co-Primary Efficacy Endpoints: Mean Change in Frequency and Severity of Hot Flashes Per Week Versus Placebo at Weeks 4 and 12, VMS-MITT Population Estradiol/Progesterone	 	1 mg/100 mg	 	0.5 mg/100 mg	 	0.5 mg/50 mg	 	0.25 mg/50 mg	 	Placebo  	 	(n = 141)	 	(n = 149)	 	(n = 147)	 	(n = 154)	 	(n = 135) Frequency  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Week 4 P-value versus placebo		<0.001		0.013		0.141		0.001		- Week 12 P-value versus placebo	 	<0.001	 	<0.001	 	0.002	 	<0.001	 	-   Severity  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Week 4 P-value versus placebo		0.031		0.005		0.401		0.100		- Week 12 P-value versus placebo	 	<0.001	 	<0.001	 	0.018	 	0.096	 	- Replenish Trial Primary Safety Endpoint: Incidence of Consensus Endometrial Hyperplasia or Malignancy up to 12 months, Endometrial Safety Population(Ŧ)  	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	  Endometrial Hyperplasia	 	0% (0/280)	 	0% (0/303)	 	0% (0/306)	 	0% (0/274)	 	0% (0/92) MITT = Modified intent to treat ŦPer FDA, consensus hyperplasia refers to the concurrence of two of the three pathologists be accepted as the final diagnosis1 P-value < 0.05 meets FDA guidance and supports evidence of efficacy “We are very pleased that multiple doses of TX-001HR studied in the Replenish Trial demonstrated these positive results, suggesting that, if approved, this drug product candidate is poised to address the significant demand for bio-identical hormone therapy,” said Chief Executive Officer Robert G. Finizio. “We have successfully advanced the science for post-menopausal women’s health by finding a way to effectively combine bio-identical estradiol and bio-identical progesterone. The need for a bio-identical FDA-approved combination therapy has been unanswered for decades, driving women to use unapproved drugs mixed together by independent and community pharmacies that compound these products. We believe that TX-001HR, if approved, will provide women, healthcare providers and pharmacists with a proven safe, effective and insurance reimbursed bio-identical combination product, finally answering that need. We will continue to evaluate these promising data, and look forward to submitting a New Drug Application for TX-001HR to the Food and Drug Administration as early as the third quarter of 2017.”  The trial also demonstrated a dose response favoring the higher doses of estradiol in combination with progesterone. The availability of multiple doses of TX-001HR would allow for individualized therapy to meet the needs of a diverse population of women.  The most common adverse events (>5 percent) reported on average in all the active treatment groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, breast tenderness, and upper respiratory infection. There was a very low reported incidence of adverse events of somnolence with TX-001HR, in contrast to commercially available oral progesterone where somnolence has been reported as a significant side effect. There were no unexpected safety signals.  The Replenish Trial evaluated various secondary endpoints using well-validated patient reported outcome tools, including the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL), the Clinical Global Impression scale (CGI), and the responder analysis rate.

  SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achaogen,
Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAO), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing
novel antibacterials addressing multi-drug resistant (MDR) gram-negative
infections, today announced that its lead product candidate, plazomicin, met
the objective of non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) and achieved superiority for the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) primary efficacy endpoints in the Phase 3 EPIC
registration trial in patients with complicated urinary tract infections
(cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). In addition, in the Phase 3 CARE trial
in patients with serious infections due to carbapenem-resistant
Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) a lower rate of mortality or serious
disease-related complications was observed for plazomicin compared with
colistin therapy, one of the few remaining antibiotics for treatment of
infections due to CRE.
  ""We are thrilled with the outcome of both the EPIC and CARE clinical trials
and the potential opportunity for plazomicin to address many of the
multi-drug resistant bacterial infections occurring every day,"" said Kenneth
Hillan, M.B. Ch.B., Achaogen's Chief Executive Officer. ""We are grateful to
the patients and investigators who were involved in both of these studies,
and we look forward to seeking plazomicin's approval from FDA and EMA. We
believe that, if approved, plazomicin will provide an important new option
in treating MDR infections, including those caused by CRE.""
  Achaogen plans to submit a New Drug Application (NDA), which will include
EPIC and CARE data, to the FDA in the second half of 2017. The Company also
plans to submit a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the EMA in
2018. In addition, Achaogen plans to publicly present detailed results from
both the EPIC and CARE trials in 2017.
  ""These data are exceptional and better than I would have expected -
plazomicin's superiority in microbiologic cure for patients with cUTI at the
test-of-cure visit compared to meropenem, a gold standard for treating MDR
infections, is impressive. Importantly, the safety profile of the drug looks
favorable,"" said James A. McKinnell, Assistant Professor of Medicine at the
David Geffen School of Medicine and LA Biomed at Harbor-UCLA. ""The data from
the CARE trial provides compelling evidence for plazomicin as a treatment
option for serious infections due to CRE. The sample size for the CARE study
was small, but the data show a clear trend in favor of plazomicin in terms
of efficacy and overall safety compared to colistin. CRE infections cause
serious morbidity and mortality and seem to be on the rise. Based on these
data, plazomicin would be a valuable addition to my short list of available
treatment options for both empiric and directed treatment of patients, and
as a single agent or in combination with other antibiotics.""
  In the EPIC trial, plazomicin successfully met the objective of
non-inferiority compared to meropenem for the FDA-specified primary efficacy
endpoints, and achieved superiority for the EMA-specified primary efficacy
endpoints.
  Results for FDA pre-specified composite endpoint of clinical cure and
microbiological eradication in the microbiological modified intent-to-treat
(mMITT) population were as follows:
   -- Day 5: 88.0% plazomicin vs. 91.4% meropenem (difference -3.4%, 95% CI:
      -10.0, 3.1%), indicating statistical non-inferiority

  Plazomicin was well tolerated with no new safety concerns identified in the
EPIC trial. Total treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) related to renal
function were reported in 3.6% and 1.3% of patients in the plazomicin and
meropenem groups, respectively. TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular
function were reported in a single patient in each of the plazomicin and
meropenem treatment groups. Both events were considered mild and resolved
completely.
  In the Phase 3 CARE trial in patients with serious infections due to CRE a
lower rate of mortality or serious disease-related complications was
observed for plazomicin compared with colistin therapy.
  Results from the CARE trial were as follows:

  The safety profile of plazomicin was favorable to that of colistin in
critically ill patients in the CARE trial. Study drug-related TEAEs related
to renal function were reported in 16.7% and 38.1% of patients in the
plazomicin and colistin groups, respectively. No TEAEs related to cochlear
or vestibular function were reported in either group.
  About the EPIC Trial
  EPIC (Evaluating plazomicin in cUTI) was a multinational, randomized,
controlled, double-blind clinical trial in adult patients with complicated
urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). The trial
enrolled 609 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive plazomicin 15 mg/kg
as a once daily 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion or meropenem 1.0 gram
every 8 hours as a 30 minute IV infusion. After a minimum of 4 days of IV
therapy, patients who met protocol-defined criteria for improvement were
allowed to step-down to oral levofloxacin to complete a total of 7 to 10
days of therapy (IV plus oral).
  About the CARE Trial
  CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) was a
multinational, open label, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy
and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due
to CRE. The study included two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1 (N=39) was a
randomized, comparator-controlled cohort to compare plazomicin with colistin
(either in combination with meropenem or tigecycline) for the treatment of
bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or
ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) due to CRE. Cohort 1
enrolled 30 patients with BSI and 9 patients with HABP/VABP. Cohort 2 (N=30)
was a single-arm expanded access cohort to evaluate plazomicin-based therapy
in patients with BSI, HABP/VABP or cUTI due to CRE who were not eligible for
enrollment in Cohort 1.
  The primary analysis for Cohort 1 was conducted in the mMITT population
(patients with confirmed CRE infection) and was defined as all-cause
mortality at Day 28 or significant disease related complications. Due to
limitations of the small sample size, no formal statistical hypothesis
testing was performed, but a two-sided 90% exact confidence interval is
provided to describe the degree of variability around the observed
differences.","Achaogen Announces Positive Results in Phase 3 cUTI and CRE Clinical Trials of Plazomicin   -- EPIC registration trial successfully achieves FDA primary endpoints in patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) --   -- EPIC demonstrates superiority on EMA primary endpoints --   -- CARE descriptive trial shows 71 percent relative reduction in Day 28 all-cause mortality compared with colistin in patients with serious CRE infections --   -- Plazomicin well tolerated in both trials and shows improved overall safety compared with colistin in CARE trial --   -- Company plans to proceed with regulatory submissions in the U.S. and Europe --   -- Company to host a conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. EST --   SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 12, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achaogen, Inc.

No TEAEs related to cochlear or vestibular function were reported in either group.   About the EPIC Trial   EPIC (Evaluating plazomicin in cUTI) was a multinational, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trial in adult patients with complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) and acute pyelonephritis (AP). The trial enrolled 609 patients who were randomized 1:1 to receive plazomicin 15 mg/kg as a once daily 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion or meropenem 1.0 gram every 8 hours as a 30 minute IV infusion. After a minimum of 4 days of IV therapy, patients who met protocol-defined criteria for improvement were allowed to step-down to oral levofloxacin to complete a total of 7 to 10 days of therapy (IV plus oral).   About the CARE Trial   CARE (Combating Antibiotic Resistant Enterobacteriaceae) was a multinational, open label, Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of plazomicin in patients with serious bacterial infections due to CRE. The study included two cohorts of patients. Cohort 1 (N=39) was a randomized, comparator-controlled cohort to compare plazomicin with colistin (either in combination with meropenem or tigecycline) for the treatment of bloodstream infection (BSI), hospital acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) or ventilator associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) due to CRE. Cohort 1 enrolled 30 patients with BSI and 9 patients with HABP/VABP. Cohort 2 (N=30) was a single-arm expanded access cohort to evaluate plazomicin-based therapy in patients with BSI, HABP/VABP or cUTI due to CRE who were not eligible for enrollment in Cohort 1.   The primary analysis for Cohort 1 was conducted in the mMITT population (patients with confirmed CRE infection) and was defined as all-cause mortality at Day 28 or significant disease related complications. Due to limitations of the small sample size, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was performed, but a two-sided 90% exact confidence interval is provided to describe the degree of variability around the observed differences.",,120%

  WALTHAM, Mass., Dec. 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Proteon Therapeutics, Inc.
(Nasdaq:PRTO), a company developing novel, first-in-class therapeutics to
address the medical needs of patients with kidney and vascular diseases,
today announced that its first Phase 3 clinical trial with investigational
vonapanitase, PATENCY-1, did not meet its primary endpoint of improved
primary unassisted patency compared to placebo (p=0.254). However, the
top-line results for the trial's secondary endpoint suggested that
vonapanitase may improve secondary patency compared to placebo (p=0.048).
Data from one of the trial's three tertiary endpoints also suggested
vonapanitase may improve unassisted fistula use for hemodialysis (p=0.035)
and any use of the fistula (unassisted or assisted) for hemodialysis
(p=0.006). Adverse events reported for vonapanitase were similar to placebo.

  PATENCY-1 evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of vonapanitase
in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) receiving or expecting to
receive hemodialysis who underwent surgical creation of a radiocephalic
arteriovenous fistula. The multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled 313 patients at 31 medical
centers in the United States. Patients in the trial were followed for up to
one year.
  The trial's primary endpoint, primary unassisted patency, is the length of
time from fistula surgical creation to the first occurrence of a fistula
thrombosis or corrective procedure to restore or maintain patency (blood
flow). In PATENCY-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 17% reduction in
the risk of primary unassisted patency loss over one year, compared to
placebo (p=0.254). At the end of one year, 42% of patients who received
vonapanitase retained primary unassisted patency, compared to 31% of
placebo-treated patients.
  The Kaplan-Meier curves for primary unassisted patency can be accessed in
Figure 1:
http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/fae4524b-a782-4332-87fd-550fa9fb87c2

  PATENCY-1's secondary endpoint, secondary patency, is the length of time
from surgical creation until fistula abandonment (final failure). In
PATENCY-1, vonapanitase-treated patients had a 34% reduction in the risk of
secondary patency loss over one year, compared to placebo (p=0.048). At the
end of one year, 74% of vonapanitase-treated patients maintained secondary
patency, compared to 61% of placebo-treated patients.
  The Kaplan-Meier curves for secondary patency can be accessed in Figure 2:
http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/0e48c0e7-33e4-4053-8ecb-ee40f1dd2248

  Top-line results also included the following tertiary endpoint data:
   -- Use for Hemodialysis. 39.2% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved
      unassisted use of their fistula for dialysis, compared to 25.0% of
      placebo-treated patients (p=0.035). 63.9% of vonapanitase-treated
      patients used their fistula for dialysis (unassisted or assisted),
      compared to 44.4% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.006). Use for
      hemodialysis was defined as continuous use of the fistula for
      hemodialysis for at least 90 days or, if hemodialysis was not initiated
      at least 90 days prior to the patient's last visit, for at least 30 days

      prior to the patient's last visit and in use at the patient's last
visit.
      Unassisted use was defined as use without prior loss of primary
      unassisted patency.

   -- Unassisted Maturation. 62.9% of vonapanitase-treated patients reached
      unassisted maturation, compared to 53.4% of placebo-treated patients
      (p=0.109). Unassisted maturation by ultrasound criteria, a tertiary
      endpoint, was defined as achieving a vein diameter >=4 millimeters and
      blood flow >=500 milliliters per minute by three months without loss of
      primary patency.

   -- Rate of Procedures to Restore or Maintain Patency. Over one year,
      vonapanitase-treated patients had 1.10 procedures per patient per year
      versus placebo-treated patients who had 1.48 procedures per patient per
      year (p=0.479). Procedures included thrombectomy, angioplasty, stent
      deployment and surgical revision.
  The proportions of patients reporting adverse events (AEs) were comparable
between the vonapanitase and placebo arms of the study. The most common AEs
were consistent with medical events experienced by CKD patients undergoing
radiocephalic fistula surgery and are summarized in the table below.
  Proportions of Patients Experiencing Common Adverse Events

 Adverse Events                            N=209       N=102
Vascular stenosis                         38.3%        40.2%
Fistula thrombosis                        19.6%        26.5%
Hypoaesthesia (numbness)                   5.3%         4.9%
Procedural pain                            4.8%         5.9%

Note: Includes any adverse event that occurred in
 at least 5% of patients in either treatment group.


  ""We are disappointed that the study missed the primary endpoint. However, it
appears that vonapanitase had a drug effect and we are encouraged by the
secondary patency and fistula use for hemodialysis findings in this trial,
both of which we believe are clinically important,"" said Steven Burke, M.D.,
Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Proteon Therapeutics. ""We
plan to review the full data set from PATENCY-1 and further investigate
these findings in our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, PATENCY-2.""
  ""We want to thank the clinical investigators and the patients and their
families who volunteered to participate in PATENCY-1.  We have always
recognized that this is an important and complex area of clinical
development and Proteon remains committed to the dialysis patient
community,"" stated Timothy Noyes, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Proteon Therapeutics. ""Because of the clinical importance of fistula
abandonment and fistula use for hemodialysis to both patients and
physicians, we plan to increase the planned enrollment of PATENCY-2 and look
for other ways to use these results to guide our development efforts.""
  As of November 30, 2016, Proteon had cash, cash equivalents and
available-for-sale investments of $43.3 million. The Company expects these
financial resources will be sufficient to fund its operations into the third
quarter of 2018 based upon changes to our operating plan that we intend to
implement.

  About PATENCY-1 and PATENCY-2
  PATENCY-1 and PATENCY-2 are Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with chronic kidney disease
(CKD) receiving or expecting to receive hemodialysis and undergoing surgical
creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. The
studies were designed to evaluate, over one year, whether a single
administration of 30 micrograms of vonapanitase can improve radiocephalic
fistula patency, the period of time during which a fistula remains open with
adequate blood flow to enable hemodialysis. Proteon today announced results
of PATENCY-1, which enrolled 313 patients at 31 centers in the United
States. Proteon continues to enroll patients in PATENCY-2, the second Phase
3 clinical trial. Proteon expects to reach enrollment of 300 patients in
this trial at approximately 40 centers in the United States and Canada in
the first quarter of 2017. Proteon expects to report top-line results from
PATENCY-2 in the second quarter of 2018.
  About Chronic Kidney Disease, Hemodialysis and Vascular Access
  In the most severe stage of chronic kidney disease (CKD), also known as
kidney failure, the kidneys can no longer function to sustain life. The
majority of patients with kidney failure undergo chronic hemodialysis, which
requires a high-flow vascular access to repeatedly connect the patient's
bloodstream to a hemodialysis machine for this life-saving treatment. The
preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a radiocephalic
arteriovenous fistula, created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery
in the lower arm, resulting in a substantial increase in blood flow and vein
dilation. No FDA approved preventative treatments currently exist to improve
fistula patency.

The preferred form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula, created when a surgeon connects a vein to an artery in the lower arm, resulting in a substantial increase in blood flow and vein dilation. No FDA approved preventative treatments currently exist to improve fistula patency. ",,-70%

Conference Call and Webcast Today, December 12, 2016 at 8:30 a.m. ET - 
Ophthotech Corporation (Nasdaq:OPHT) today announced that the pre-specified primary endpoint of mean change in visual acuity at 12 months was not achieved in its two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials investigating the superiority of Fovista® (pegpleranib) anti-PDGF therapy in combination with Lucentis® (ranibizumab) anti-VEGF therapy compared to Lucentis® monotherapy for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The addition of Fovista® to a monthly Lucentis® regimen did not result in benefit as measured by the mean change in visual acuity at the 12 month time point. 

“We are very disappointed in the results from these trials, particularly for patients afflicted with wet AMD,” commented David R. Guyer, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Ophthotech. “We are thankful to the patients and clinical investigators and their staff for participating in the trials. We will continue to analyze the data from these two studies to better understand the trial results.” 

The two clinical trials (OPH1002 and OPH1003) were international, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, controlled Phase 3 studies evaluating the safety and efficacy of 1.5 mg of Fovista® administered in combination with Lucentis® (Fovista® combination therapy) compared to Lucentis® monotherapy. In each of these trials, patients were randomized to one of two approximately equal sized treatment groups. The two Phase 3 trials enrolled an aggregate of 1,248 patients with wet AMD. The results from the databases of the two trials were unmasked and analyzed concurrently. 

The combined analysis from the two trials (OPH1002 and OPH1003) showed that patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.24 letters of vision on the Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.01 ETDRS letters for patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a difference of 0.23 ETDRS letters. In OPH1002, consisting of 619 treated patients, subjects receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 10.74 letters of vision on the ETDRS standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 9.82 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of 0.92 ETDRS letters (p=0.44). In OPH1003, consisting of 626 treated patients, subjects receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained a mean of 9.91 letters of vision on the ETDRS standardized chart at 12 months, compared to a mean gain of 10.36 ETDRS letters in patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy, a resulting difference of -0.44 ETDRS letters (p=0.71). None of these results of the pre-specified primary efficacy analysis were statistically significant. 

In the pooled analysis of pre-specified secondary endpoints from both trials, 24.2% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 22.1% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 25.9% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 20.0% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 22.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy gained 20 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 24.1% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

In the pooled analysis, 12.1% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters from baseline at month 12, compared to 11.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 12.0% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 12.3% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 12.2% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy lost 5 or more ETDRS letters at month 12, compared to 10.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

In addition, in the pooled analysis, 13.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better at month 12, compared to 13.9% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1002, 13.6% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 13.2% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. In OPH1003, 13.5% of patients receiving Fovista® combination therapy achieved visual acuity of 20/25 or better, compared to 14.6% of patients receiving Lucentis® monotherapy. 

Based on a preliminary analysis of the safety data from these two trials, Fovista® combination therapy and Lucentis® monotherapy were generally well tolerated after one year of treatment. The ocular adverse events more frequently reported in the Fovista® combination therapy group compared to the Lucentis® monotherapy group were mainly related to the injection procedure. The incidence of reported serious systemic adverse events was generally similar in both treatment groups as was the incidence of myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident.

Potential Study of Egalet-002
  PR Newswire
  WAYNE, Pa., Dec. 16, 2016
  WAYNE, Pa., Dec. 16, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT)
(""Egalet""), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on
developing, manufacturing and marketing innovative treatments for pain and
other conditions, today announced positive top-line results from a Category
3 intranasal human abuse potential (HAP) study of Egalet-002, an
abuse-deterrent, extended-release oxycodone product candidate which uses
Egalet's Guardian(TM) Technology. Egalet-002 is in late-stage development
for the management of pain severe enough to require daily around-the-clock,
long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative treatment options are
inadequate.
  ""Given that intranasal abuse is the most common form of non-oral oxycodone
abuse, these results, having hit the primary endpoint of reduced maximum
drug liking, are promising,"" said Bob Radie, president and chief executive
officer. ""We will look to submit the full data for presentation at a medical
meeting in 2017.""
  Egalet-002 was designed using a version of Egalet's proprietary Guardian
Technology that contains an inner matrix and an exterior shell. This results
in tablets with controlled-release properties as well as physical and
chemical features that have been demonstrated to resist both common and
rigorous methods of manipulation, in order to deter common routes of abuse.
The physical hardness of the tablet and the gelling effect of the matrix are
designed to give Egalet-002 its physical and chemical abuse-deterrent
characteristics.
  The study was a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled
6-period crossover study. The study evaluated the abuse potential of
manipulated Egalet-002 compared to crushed immediate-release (IR) oxycodone
through the nasal route in 46 non-dependent recreational opioid users
experienced in nasal insufflation. A comparison to manipulated OxyContin(R)
(oxycodone hydrochloride) was also included as an exploratory arm. The study
was conducted in accordance with the FDA's Guidance for Industry,
Abuse-Deterrent Opioids -- Evaluation and Labeling (April, 2015), and used
more aggressive methods of manipulation for Egalet-002 identified from the
Category 1 in vitro laboratory studies which were needed to get Egalet-002
into a snortable form.
  The treatment periods included: Egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell
on), Egalet-002 40 mg (manipulated with shell taken off through an
additional manipulation step), crushed IR oxycodone 40 mg, manipulated
OxyContin 40 mg, manipulated Egalet-002 placebo tablet, and placebo powder.
The primary study endpoint was Drug Liking measured on a bipolar 100-point
scale, where 50 is neutral, 100 is maximum liking and 0 is maximum
disliking.
  Top-line results from the study include:
   -- For the primary comparison, the difference in maximum Drug Liking (Emax)

      between manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5) was significantly
      lower compared to crushed IR oxycodone (86.6); p = 0.0004

          -- This outcome was also significant for the comparison between
             manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4) and crushed IR
             oxycodone (86.6); p < 0.0001

   -- For the secondary outcome of Take Drug Again (measured on a bipolar
      100-point scale), the results were 69.9 for manipulated Egalet-002
(shell
      on), 72.4 for manipulated Egalet-002 (shell off), and 75.5 for crushed
IR
      oxycodone; not statistically significant for either comparison

   -- In the exploratory analysis with OxyContin, Emax Drug Liking was similar

      in all treatment arms: manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 79.5),
      manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 77.4), and manipulated OxyContin

      (76.2)

          -- Ease of Snorting and Pleasantness of Snorting were also assessed
             using unipolar 100-point scales where 100 represented 'very
             easy'/'very pleasant' and 0 meant 'very hard'/'very unpleasant';
             results were as follows:

                 -- Ease of Snorting was significantly harder for manipulated
                    Egalet-002 (with shell on; 42.0) and manipulated
Egalet-002
                    (with shell off; 49.5) compared to manipulated OxyContin
                    (65.1); p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0050, respectively

                 -- Pleasantness of Snorting was significantly lower for
                    manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell on; 40.7) and
                    manipulated Egalet-002 (with shell off; 44.7) compared to
                    manipulated OxyContin (55.3); p = 0.0003 and p = 0.0081,
                    respectively
  Guardian(TM) Technology
  Egalet's Guardian Technology has many applications and has been used to
develop abuse-deterrent forms of commonly abused prescription medications.
Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet
technology that utilizes a novel application of the well characterized
manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets that
are more difficult to manipulate for misuse and abuse. This approach offers
the ability to design tablets with controlled-release profiles as well as
physical and chemical properties that have been demonstrated to resist both
common and rigorous methods of manipulation. Tablets manufactured with
Guardian Technology have been shown to have increased resistance to physical
methods of manipulation, such as cutting, crushing, grinding or breaking
using a variety of tools. They are also resistant to chemical manipulation
and extraction and turn into a viscous hydrogel on contact with liquid,
making syringeability very difficult. Egalet-002 was designed using a
version of Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology that contains an inner
matrix and an exterior shell while ARYMO ER uses a different version of the
Guardian Technology.
  About Egalet

Mid-Cycle Communication Meeting with FDA completed
Additional clinical information for 500mg and 625mg BID dose groups to be provided by the Company today
Clovis Oncology, Inc. (NASDAQ: CLVS) today announced that during its regularly scheduled Mid-Cycle Communication Meeting held last week with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the agency requested additional clinical data for use in the efficacy analysis for both the 500mg and 625mg BID dose patient groups for rociletinib. The Company will provide this information in a Major Amendment to the FDA by close of business today.

“We remain confident in rociletinib and its potential to treat patients with mutant EGFR T790M-positive lung cancer, said Patrick J. Mahaffy, President and CEO of Clovis Oncology. “We will continue to work diligently with the FDA on our NDA submission.”

In the Mid-Cycle Communication meeting, the FDA emphasized that its efficacy analysis would focus solely on confirmed responses. The New Drug Application (NDA) submitted by Clovis to the FDA contained immature data sets based on both unconfirmed response rates and confirmed response rates. These data sets were updated in the 90 day efficacy update the Company submitted at the end of October.

As the rociletinib clinical trials were rapidly enrolling, Clovis presented interim data publicly and at medical meetings and these data therefore included a data set based primarily on unconfirmed responses. This was also true of the Company’s Breakthrough Therapy designation submission. In the Company’s NDA submission, both immature confirmed and unconfirmed response analyses were submitted. As the efficacy data have matured, the number of patients with an unconfirmed response who converted to a confirmed response was lower than expected.

In the intent to treat analysis of the 79 patients in the 500mg dose group, the current confirmed response rate is 28 percent, and 34 percent in the 170 patients in the 625mg dose group, with an encouraging duration of response in both doses. The most frequent reasons that patients’ responses were not confirmed in a subsequent scan were due to progression, often due to brain metastasis, and due to subsequent scans not demonstrating tumor shrinkage greater than 30 percent.

The Company anticipates that the review of this additional information will result in a delay of a potential approval. This additional review could lead to an extension of the Company’s March 30, 2016 Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date.

Conference Call Details
Clovis will hold a conference call to discuss this regulatory update later this morning, November 16, at 8:30am ET. The conference call will be simultaneously webcast on the Company’s web site at www.clovisoncology.com, and archived for future review.

(NASDAQ: PTCT) today announced that it received yesterday evening a Refuse to File letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding PTC's New Drug Application (NDA) for Translarna™ (ataluren), an oral, first-in-class, protein restoration therapy for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).

The FDA states in the Refuse to File letter that the application was not sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review.  PTC first learned of the Refuse to File decision via this letter and is reviewing its content to determine the appropriate next steps.     

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  
Primarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal, diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and twenties. It is estimated that nonsense mutations account for approximately 13% of DMD cases, or approximately 2,000 patients in the United States.

About Translarna™ (ataluren)   
Translarna, discovered and developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc., is a protein restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation. A nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely halts the synthesis of an essential protein. The resulting disorder is determined by which protein cannot be expressed in its entirety and is no longer functional, such as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Translarna is licensed in the European Economic Area for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ambulatory patients aged five years and older. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the United States. The development of Translarna has been supported by grants from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. (the nonprofit affiliate of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation); Muscular Dystrophy Association; FDA's Office of Orphan Products Development; National Center for Research Resources; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy.

The ODAC meeting is scheduled to take place on April 12, 2016 from 8:30 a.m. ET to 1 p.m. ET. Briefing materials and webcast information can be found on the FDA website at http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/Drugs/OncologicDrugsAdvisoryCommittee/ucm494781.htm.

The FDA has set a target action date of June 28, 2016 for rociletinib under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA).

About T790M-Positive Mutant EGFR NSCLC

Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in the United States, with more than 200,000 new cases each year, and is the leading cause of cancer-related death. NSCLC accounts for almost 85 percent of lung cancers, and the five-year survival rate in locally advanced and metastatic patients is 27 and four percent, respectively.

Approximately 10-15 percent of patients with NSCLC in the United States have the EGFR mutation. While the majority of these patients will respond to treatment with first- or second-generation EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), most patients will eventually develop acquired resistance to these therapies, predominantly due to the primary resistance mutation, T790M.

About Rociletinib

Rociletinib is the company’s novel, oral, targeted covalent (irreversible) mutant-selective inhibitor of EGFR in development for the treatment of NSCLC in patients with initial activating EGFR mutations, as well as the dominant resistance mutation T790M.

  About Zilretta
  Zilretta is being investigated as the first intra-articular
sustained-release, non-opioid treatment for patients with moderate to severe
knee OA pain. Zilretta employs proprietary microsphere technology combining
TCA -- a commonly administered, short-acting corticosteroid -- with a
polymer (PLGA) intended to provide persistent concentrations of drug locally
to both amplify the magnitude and prolong the duration of pain relief.
  To date, more than 600 patients have been treated with Zilretta in clinical

for LPCN 1021, an oral testosterone product candidate for testosterone
replacement therapy (""TRT"") in adult males for conditions associated with a
deficiency or absence of endogenous testosterone, also known as
hypogonadism. A CRL is a communication from the FDA that informs companies
that an application cannot be approved in its present form.
  The CRL identified deficiencies related to the dosing algorithm for the
label.  Specifically, the proposed titration scheme for clinical practice
was significantly different from the titration scheme used in the Phase 3
trial leading to discordance in titration decisions between the Phase 3
trial and real-world clinical practice.
  The next step will be to request a meeting with the FDA to understand more
fully the issues raised and to agree on a path forward to achieve approval
of LPCN 1021.
  ""We are evaluating the content of the CRL, including the FDA recommended
actions to bring our NDA in a position for approval, and will work closely
with the FDA to determine the appropriate next steps for the NDA.  We remain
committed to bringing LPCN 1021 to patients who will benefit from its

  Marketing Authorization Application to the European Medicines Agency
Currently Under Review
KENILWORTH, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--August 05, 2016--
  Merck (NYSE:MRK), known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada,
today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
accepted for review the New Drug Application (NDA) for MK-1293, an
investigational follow-on biologic(1) insulin glargine candidate for the
treatment of people with type 1 and type 2 diabetes, which is being
developed by Merck with partial funding from Samsung Bioepis.
  ""The FDA acceptance of our follow-on biologic application is an important
milestone, and brings us closer to offering another treatment option for
people in the U.S. with diabetes,"" said Peter Stein, M.D., vice president,
late stage development, diabetes and endocrinology, Merck. ""We are proud of
the significant contributions we have already made to helping people with
type 2 diabetes, and with investigational MK-1293, we hope to expand our
portfolio into insulin therapeutics and treatments for people with type 1
diabetes.""
  The development program for MK-1293 was designed to meet rigorous regulatory
standards for follow-on biologics of clinical and nonclinical safety,
efficacy and quality. In addition to Phase 1 studies assessing its
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, the NDA submission for
MK-1293 includes results of two Phase 3 studies, one conducted in people
with type 1 diabetes, and one in people with type 2 diabetes; Lantus(R)
(insulin glargine)(2) , the originator insulin glargine, was the active
comparator in both studies.
  The NDA was filed through the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway(3) , which allows
the FDA to reference previous findings of safety and efficacy for an
already-approved product (Lantus), in addition to reviewing findings from
studies of MK-1293. Separately, the Marketing Authorization Application for
MK-1293, which Merck submitted to the European Medicines Agency in December
2015, is currently under review.

Fast Track Designation
  Company Also Provides Update On New Interim Analysis From Phase 1b Study
CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--September 01, 2016--
  Today Biogen (NASDAQ: BIIB) announced that aducanumab, its investigational
treatment for early Alzheimer's disease (AD), was granted Fast Track
designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA's Fast
Track program supports the development of new treatments for serious
conditions with an unmet medical need such as Alzheimer's disease.
  ""By collaborating with regulators through programs like Fast Track, we hope
to bring effective treatments to patients and families affected by
Alzheimer's disease as quickly as possible,"" said Alfred Sandrock, M.D.,
Ph.D., executive vice president and chief medical officer at Biogen.
  Aducanumab is currently being evaluated in two global Phase 3 studies,
ENGAGE and EMERGE, which are designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy in
slowing cognitive impairment and the progression of disability in people
with early Alzheimer's disease.
  For more information about the Phase 3 studies, including information about
participating centers, visit www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02477800 or
NCT02484547).
  Update: Phase 1b Data
  PRIME is the ongoing Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multiple-dose study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
(PK), pharmacodynamics (PD) and clinical effects of aducanumab in patients
with prodromal or mild AD.
  The placebo-controlled portion of the study included fixed doses of
aducanumab at 1, 3, 6 and 10 mg/kg and a titration regimen. PRIME also has a
long-term extension for patients who completed the one-year
placebo-controlled portion of the study.
  In a recently completed interim analysis from PRIME, efficacy and safety
data were consistent with results previously reported. These data support
the design of the ongoing Phase 3 ENGAGE and EMERGE studies. Biogen plans to
share detailed information about these results at upcoming medical meetings.


  About Aducanumab
  Aducanumab (BIIB037) is an investigational compound being developed for the
treatment of early AD. Aducanumab is a human recombinant monoclonal antibody
(mAb) derived from a de-identified library of B cells collected from healthy
elderly subjects with no signs of cognitive impairment or cognitively
impaired elderly subjects with unusually slow cognitive decline using
Neurimmune's technology platform called Reverse Translational Medicine
(RTM). Biogen licensed aducanumab from Neurimmune under a collaborative
development and license agreement.
  Aducanumab is thought to target aggregated forms of beta amyloid including
soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils deposited into the amyloid plaque in
the brain of AD patients. Based on pre-clinical and interim Phase 1b data,
treatment with aducanumab has been shown to reduce amyloid plaque levels.
  About Alzheimer's Disease
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
characterized by cognitive decline and behavioral disturbances that
eventually result in a person's inability to perform daily activities. In
2010, it was estimated that 25 million individuals were living with AD
worldwide(1) . Evidence suggests that pathophysiological changes typically
begin years prior to the symptoms that lead to a clinical diagnosis. As the
disease progresses, cognitive impairments, behavioral changes and functional
disability commonly associated with AD begin to manifest.

  PR Newswire
  SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 17, 2016
  SOUTH PLAINFIELD, N.J., Oct. 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- PTC Therapeutics, Inc.
(NASDAQ: PTCT) today provided a regulatory update on Translarna(TM)
(ataluren) for the treatment of nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular
dystrophy (nmDMD).
  U.S. regulatory update
  PTC Therapeutics announced today that at the end of last week, the Office of
Drug Evaluation I (ODE-I) of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
denied the company's first appeal of the refuse to file letter issued by the
FDA's Division of Neurological Products (DNP) on February 22, 2016 regarding
PTC's New Drug Application (NDA) for Translarna for the treatment of
nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy (nmDMD).
  The company intends to escalate its appeal to the next supervisory level of
the FDA. This is an iterative process and the company anticipates that
multiple cycles of appeals to progressively higher levels of the FDA may be
required.
  PTC continues to assert that a proper assessment of the data and analyses
from multiple clinical studies, including two of the largest
placebo-controlled trials ever conducted in DMD, can only be accomplished in
the context of a full and fair review by the FDA. This would include an
advisory committee meeting that allows clinical experts and representatives
of the patient community to express their views on Translarna for the
treatment of nmDMD. The company believes that Translarna is the only therapy
in clinical development designed to target the underlying cause of nmDMD. In
addition, a favorable safety profile has been consistently demonstrated in
PTC's clinical trials, which have enrolled over 1,000 individuals to date.
  ""We believe that fair consideration of the totality of Translarna's data
requires a full review of our application by the FDA,"" said Stuart W. Peltz,
Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. ""In light of this,
continuing the formal dispute resolution process reflects our ongoing
commitment to work with regulators and the Duchenne community to make
Translarna available to nmDMD patients in the United States.""
  In addition, the company maintains its position that PTC should, under
existing law and in fairness to patients, be provided the same opportunity
for full review that the DNP gave to other recent applicants for products in
development for different subsets of the DMD population.
  ""I am disappointed that a treatment for patients with nonsense mutation DMD
is still not receiving a fair opportunity in front of the FDA,"" said Pat
Furlong, President and Founder of Parent Project Muscular Dystrophy. ""This
inconsistency is unacceptable and is concerning for the entire community.
This devastating, muscle-wasting disease cuts short the lives of boys and
young men and every day that we wait for treatments, is a day in which
muscle function is lost and not regained. As a community, we cannot rest
until there are treatments for all the boys and young men.""
  European regulatory update
  PTC recently participated in an oral explanation meeting before the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)
in connection with the company's ongoing annual renewal of its marketing
authorization for Translarna for the treatment of nmDMD in ambulatory
patients aged five years and older. The marketing authorization in the
European Economic Area (EEA), originally granted in August 2014, is subject
to an annual renewal process, including an assessment by European regulators
of a risk-benefit profile in favor of Translarna authorization.
  Following conclusion of the recent oral explanation, the CHMP issued a
request for supplemental information (RSI), including a request categorized
as a major objection. Generally speaking, renewal of a marketing
authorization requires a company to adequately address the points raised in
a major objection. As with prior RSIs received by the company during this
renewal process, the major objection relates to the efficacy and overall
risk-benefit profile of Translarna as well as the design and conduct of an
additional clinical trial that would provide comprehensive clinical data.
The RSIs also include requests categorized as other concerns, which do not
rise to the level of a major objection, and are generally associated with
the primary pharmacology of Translarna and label matters.
  The company continues to believe that if the CHMP issues a positive opinion
in favor of the renewal of Translarna's marketing authorization, such
renewal, and any subsequent annual renewals, will be coupled with an
obligation to conduct an agreed upon new clinical trial of Translarna for
the treatment of nmDMD. The EMA could also impose other new conditions to
the authorization for renewal or make other recommendations, including the
potential withdrawal of the marketing authorization.
  PTC anticipates that an opinion regarding its marketing authorization
renewal request will be adopted by the CHMP before the end of 2016. The
company expects that its current marketing authorization will remain valid
while the EMA's assessment is ongoing and until it is concluded with a
decision from the European Commission.
  About Translarna(TM) (ataluren)
  Translarna, discovered and developed by PTC Therapeutics, Inc., is a protein
restoration therapy designed to enable the formation of a functioning
protein in patients with genetic disorders caused by a nonsense mutation. A
nonsense mutation is an alteration in the genetic code that prematurely
halts the synthesis of an essential protein. The resulting disorder is
determined by which protein cannot be expressed in its entirety and is no
longer functional, such as dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
Translarna is licensed in the European Economic Area for the treatment of
nonsense mutation Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ambulatory patients aged
five years and older. Translarna is an investigational new drug in the
United States. The development of Translarna has been supported by grants
from Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics Inc. (the nonprofit affiliate
of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation); Muscular Dystrophy Association; FDA's
Office of Orphan Products Development; National Center for Research
Resources; National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute; and Parent Project
Muscular Dystrophy.
  About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy
  Primarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a
progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin
protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal,
diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD, the more severe form of the
disorder, lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience
life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and
twenties. It is estimated that a nonsense mutation is the cause of DMD in
approximately 13 per cent of patients.
  About PTC Therapeutics

About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy   Primarily affecting males, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by the lack of functional dystrophin protein. Dystrophin is critical to the structural stability of skeletal, diaphragm, and heart muscles. Patients with DMD, the more severe form of the disorder, lose the ability to walk as early as age 10 and experience life-threatening lung and heart complications in their late teens and twenties. It is estimated that a nonsense mutation is the cause of DMD in approximately 13 per cent of patients.

Manufacturer for Auryxia(R) (ferric citrate)
  Auryxia is now available for prescription in the U.S.
  BOSTON, Nov. 09, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.
(Nasdaq:KERX), a biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative
medicines to people with renal disease, today announced that the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved its application for a second drug
product contract manufacturer. Patheon Manufacturing Services LLC of
Greenville, North Carolina, a leading global provider of pharmaceutical
manufacturing services, is now an FDA approved drug product manufacturer of
Auryxia(R). With FDA approval of this manufacturer, the company has rebuilt
supply and will promptly make Auryxia available to wholesalers.
  ""We are pleased with today's approval, as it expands our manufacturing
capabilities and capacity,"" said Greg Madison, president and chief executive
officer of Keryx Biopharmaceuticals. ""Getting a second drug product
manufacturer approved was an important step to ensuring long-term supply of
Auryxia is consistently available to patients.""
  Mr. Madison continued, ""We are looking forward to attending American Society
of Nephrology's Kidney Week, the global, premier kidney conference. The
timing of this conference next week gives us the opportunity to communicate
with health care professionals in attendance that Auryxia supply is restored
and is once again available for their patients.""
  About Auryxia(R)
  Auryxia (ferric citrate) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration on September 5, 2014 and is indicated in the U.S. for the
control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD on dialysis. The
U.S. approval of Auryxia was based on data from the company's Phase 3
registration program. In the Phase 3 clinical trials, Auryxia effectively
reduced serum phosphorus levels to within the KDOQI guidelines range of 3.5
to 5.5 mg/dL.
  Auryxia binds with dietary phosphate in the GI tract and precipitates as
ferric phosphate. The unbound portion of Auryxia has been shown to increase
serum iron parameters including ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT).
Iron absorption from Auryxia may lead to excessive elevations in iron
stores. Accordingly, physicians should assess and monitor iron parameters
before starting and while on Auryxia, and may need to decrease or
discontinue IV iron for these patients. The most common adverse events for
Auryxia treated patients were gastrointestinal related, including diarrhea,
nausea, vomiting and constipation. For more information about Auryxia and
the U.S. full prescribing information, visit www.Auryxia.com.
  IMPORTANT U.S. SAFETY INFORMATION FOR AURYXIA(R) (ferric citrate)
  Contraindication: Patients with iron overload syndrome, e.g.
hemochromatosis, should not take Auryxia(R).
  Iron Overload: Iron absorption from Auryxia may lead to increased iron in
storage sites. Iron parameters should be monitored prior to and while on
Auryxia. Patients receiving IV iron may require a reduction in dose or
discontinuation of IV iron therapy.
  Accidental Overdose of Iron: Accidental overdose of iron containing products
is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6 years of age. Keep
Auryxia away from children as it contains iron. Call a poison control center
or your physician in case of an accidental overdose in a child.
  Patients with Gastrointestinal Bleeding or Inflammation: Safety has not been
established for these patients.
  Adverse Events: The most common adverse events with Auryxia were diarrhea
(21%), nausea (11%), constipation (8%), vomiting (7%) and cough (6%).
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were the most common reason for
discontinuing Auryxia (14%). Auryxia contains iron and may cause dark
stools, which is considered normal with oral medications containing iron.
  Drug Interactions: Doxycycline should be taken at least 1 hour before
Auryxia. Ciprofloxacin should be taken at least 2 hours before or after
Auryxia.

DVAX,11/14/16,Biotech,Regulatory,MarketWired,Dynavax Receives Complete Response Letter from U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Biologics License Application for HEPLISAV-B,S.IW DVAX .NASDAQ PBBI.IW .PHARMA PBDR.IW PBTR.IW CC.IW .CC CC.IW,"BERKELEY, CA--(Marketwired - November 14, 2016) - Dynavax Technologies Corporation (NASDAQ: DVAX) today announced that it has received a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding its Biologics License Application (BLA) for HEPLISAV-B™ [Hepatitis B Vaccine, Recombinant (Adjuvanted)] for immunization of adults 18 years and older against hepatitis B infection. The FDA issues CRLs to communicate that the Agency has completed a review cycle of an application and to request additional information for review and approval. Dynavax expects a Class 2 designation for a resubmission of the BLA, which would result in a target review period of six months.

The CRL seeks information regarding several topics, including clarification regarding specific adverse events of special interest (AESIs), a numerical imbalance in a small number of cardiac events in a single study (HBV-23), new analyses of the integrated safety data base across different time periods, and post-marketing commitments. In the CRL, the FDA acknowledged that it has not yet completed its review of responses received from Dynavax in early October, including those pertaining to AESIs and the numerical imbalance in cardiac events. The responses included an extensive analysis that included independent expert consultation supporting our view that the imbalance was driven by an unexpectedly low number of events in the comparator arm. It would appear the Agency could not fully assess the responses in the current review period. In the CRL, there is no request for additional clinical trials and there are no apparent concerns with rare serious autoimmune events.

""The CRL is consistent with our opinion that HEPLISAV-B is approvable and we are seeking to meet with the FDA as soon as possible,"" said Eddie Gray, chief executive officer of Dynavax. ""However, the time and resources that will be required to gain approval leads us to consider that we may not be able to advance this program on our own and we are moving swiftly to identify a potential pharmaceutical or financial partner. We will maintain our efforts on the oncology programs, including our lead cancer immunotherapy candidate, SD-101, for which we recently announced encouraging early clinical data in metastatic melanoma.""

Conference Call Details 
The Dynavax management team will host a conference call and webcast today, Monday, November 14, 2016, at 8:30 a.m. Eastern, to provide more information about the CRL. The live call can be accessed by phone by dialing (877) 479-1857 (domestic) or +1 (503) 343-6309 (international) and specifying conference call code 19882810.

About Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a viral disease of the liver that can become chronic and can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma and death. In the United States, the CDC estimates that approximately 20,000 hepatitis B infections continue to occur annually,(i) with the vast majority occurring in adults. There is no cure for hepatitis B, and disease prevention through effective vaccination is critical to reducing the spread of the disease. Currently marketed hepatitis B vaccines are administered in three doses over a six-month schedule. Results of a published Vaccine Safety Datalink study showed that 54 percent of adults completed the currently available three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series in one year. Those who do not complete the series may not be adequately protected against hepatitis B.

About HEPLISAV-B
HEPLISAV-B is an investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine that combines hepatitis B surface antigen with a proprietary Toll-like receptor 9 agonist to enhance the immune response. HEPLISAV-B is administered in two doses over one month.

In Phase 3 trials, HEPLISAV-B demonstrated higher and earlier protection with fewer doses than a currently licensed hepatitis B vaccine. The investigational vaccine's safety profile is based on clinical trials that generated safety data from more than 14,000 participants. The most frequently reported local reaction was injection site pain. The most common systemic reactions were fatigue, headache and malaise, all of which were similar to an existing vaccine.

Dynavax has worldwide commercial rights to HEPLISAV-B.

About Dynavax
Dynavax, a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company, discovers and develops novel vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious diseases and oncology. Dynavax's lead product candidates are HEPLISAV-B, a Phase 3 investigational adult hepatitis B vaccine, and SD-101, an investigational cancer immunotherapeutic currently in several Phase 1/2 studies.

   -- U.S. patients currently enrolled in ongoing clinical extension studies
      will continue to receive migalastat
  During its review of the briefing document submitted and in discussions with
Amicus, the FDA acknowledged that significant unmet medical need exists in
Fabry disease. The agency also indicated that kidney globotriaosylceramide
(GL-3) is currently not considered a basis for an accelerated approval under
Subpart H.
  John F. Crowley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Amicus
Therapeutics, Inc. stated, ""While we believe that the totality of the data
from our studies with migalastat support the submission of a new drug
application today, we acknowledge the FDA's position that accelerated
approval based on kidney GL-3 reduction is not currently an option. We have
thus defined a plan to collect additional GI data to support full approval
for migalastat that we believe is feasible in a reasonable amount of time
and with a high likelihood of success based on positive GI data generated in
our previous Phase 3 Study 011. FDA has been flexible in allowing a
crossover design and in our use of established GI endpoints to measure
clinical benefit in Fabry patients. We are fully committed to the additional
work necessary to move migalastat toward approval in the United States.""
  More than 50% of patients with Fabry disease report or show GI signs and
symptoms, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, nausea, and
vomiting.(2) Amicus previously presented positive GI data in a completed
Phase 3 randomized, placebo controlled Study 011 (FACETS) in
treatment-na&#239;ve Fabry patients with amenable mutations. The GI data
from this study showed a significant decrease in diarrhea (unadjusted
p=0.03) in patients with amenable mutations treated with migalastat versus
placebo during the 6-month double-blind phase (Stage 1), which persisted
after 18-24 months of treatment with migalastat.
  ""There are significant unmet needs and a lack of treatment choices for
people living with Fabry disease in the U.S.,"" said Jack Johnson, Founder
and Executive Director of the Fabry Support & Information Group (FSIG).
""Amicus has been an outstanding partner for the Fabry community for more
than a decade, incorporating the patient's perspective throughout the entire
migalastat development program and providing valuable research for the Fabry
community. I look forward to the continued advancement of migalastat for
patients with amenable mutations in the U.S.""
  The U.S. market for migalastat is estimated to be approximately 25% of the
global opportunity.
  Migalastat is designed to selectively and reversibly bind with high affinity
to the active sites of certain mutant forms of alpha-Gal A, the genotypes of
which are referred to as amenable mutations. On May 30, 2016, the European
Commission granted full approval for migalastat, under the trade name
Galafold(TM), as a first line therapy for long-term treatment of adults and
adolescents aged 16 years and older with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry
disease (alpha-galactosidase A deficiency) and who have an amenable
mutation. This EU approval may serve as the basis for regulatory approvals
in more than two-thirds of the global Fabry market that is outside the U.S.
Amicus has commenced the commercial launch of Galafold in Germany and is
undergoing the EU country-by-country processes to launch in the majority of
EU countries throughout 2016 and 2017. The Company has also initiated
expanded access programs (EAP) in the EU and other territories outside the
U.S. that provide this mechanism for reimbursed access prior to formal
approval.

  About Galafold(TM) and Amenable Mutations
  Galafold(TM) (migalastat) is a first-in-class chaperone therapy approved in
the EU as a monotherapy for Fabry disease in patients with amenable
mutations. Galafold works by stabilizing the body's own dysfunctional
enzyme, so it can clear the accumulation of disease substrate in patients
who have amenable mutations.  A proprietary in vitro assay (Galafold
Amenability Assay) was used to classify more than 800 known GLA mutations as
""amenable"" or ""not amenable"" to treatment with Galafold. The current EU
label includes 313 GLA mutations that have been identified and determined to
be amenable based on the Galafold Amenability Assay, which represent between
35% and 50% of the currently diagnosed Fabry population.
  Healthcare providers in the EU may access the website
www.galafoldamenabilitytable.com to quickly and accurately identify which
mutations are categorized as ""amenable"" or ""not amenable"" to Galafold.
Amicus expects to submit updates to the label as additional GLA mutations
are identified and tested in the Galafold Amenability Assay.
  Important Safety Information from the EU Approval
  Treatment with GALAFOLD should be initiated and supervised by specialists
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of Fabry disease. GALAFOLD is not
recommended for use in patients with a nonamenable mutation.
   -- GALAFOLD is not intended for concomitant use with enzyme replacement
      therapy.


   -- GALAFOLD is not recommended for use in patients with Fabry disease who
      have severe renal impairment (<30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The safety and
      efficacy of GALAFOLD in children 0--15 years of age have not yet been
      established.


   -- No dosage adjustments are required in patients with hepatic impairment
or
      in the elderly population.


   -- There is very limited experience with the use of this medicine in
      pregnant women. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant, or are
      planning to have a baby, do not take this medicine until you have
checked
      with your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse.


   -- While taking GALAFOLD, effective birth control should be used. It is not


      known whether GALAFOLD is excreted in human milk.


   -- Contraindications to GALAFOLD include hypersensitivity to the active
      substance or to any of the excipients listed in the PRESCRIBING
      INFORMATION.


   -- It is advised to periodically monitor renal function, echocardiographic
      parameters and biochemical markers (every 6 months) in patients
initiated
      on GALAFOLD or switched to GALAFOLD.


   -- OVERDOSE: General medical care is recommended in the case of GALAFOLD
      overdose.


   -- The most common adverse reaction reported was headache, which was
      experienced by approximately 10% of patients who received GALAFOLD. For
a
      complete list of adverse reactions, please review the SUMMARY OF PRODUCT


      CHARACTERISTICS.

SAGE,12/6/16,Biotech,Regulatory,BusinessWire,Sage Announces Expedited Development Plan for SAGE-547 in the Treatment of Postpartum Depression based on FDA Breakthrough Therapy Meeting,S.BW SAGE BIOTC.BW .BIOTECH CLINT.BW FDA.BW .FDA HEALT.BW .HEALTH MHEAL.BW PHARM.BW .PHARMA PRODU.BW .PRODUCT .NASDAQ,"Current SAGE-547 clinical program is designed to support potential NDA submission; no additional controlled studies anticipated

The current trials will be expanded to Phase 3 trials to facilitate potential for global registration

If successfully developed, SAGE-547 has the potential to be the first FDA-approved treatment for postpartum depression

Sage Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SAGE), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel medicines to treat life-altering central nervous system (CNS) disorders, today announced its expedited development plan for SAGE-547 following receipt of formal meeting minutes from a breakthrough therapy meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This program is intended to support a potential filing for approval in the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD).

The current SAGE-547 program in PPD, along with prior Phase 2 data, were confirmed as supporting, if successful, a potential New Drug Application (NDA). Sage’s PPD clinical program, now in Phase 3, will require only minor modifications, including an increase in sample size. Agreement with the FDA was achieved on the clinical endpoints for these pivotal trials. Sage anticipates announcing top-line data from the PPD registration trials in 2H 2017. In July 2016, Sage reported encouraging top-line results from the 202A placebo-controlled trial in women with severe PPD, in which SAGE-547 achieved a significant, rapid and durable reduction (at Day 30) in depression scores compared with placebo.

“We are encouraged by the FDA’s feedback and appreciate their guidance regarding our SAGE-547 development program in postpartum depression,” said Jeff Jonas, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Sage. “Based on our meeting, we have clear and efficient direction for the expedited development path forward for SAGE-547 to potentially support a New Drug Application (NDA) in 2018.”

As confirmed by the FDA, the following are the elements of the expected clinical and regulatory path moving forward:

Agreement and clarity was achieved with the FDA on an expedited path forward
Current SAGE-547 clinical studies confirmed as appropriate to support registration, if successful
No additional efficacy studies expected to be required beyond those currently underway
Trial design of studies 202B and 202C are considered appropriate for registration, with increase in size and other minor modifications
The primary clinical endpoint for these pivotal trials was unchanged and agreed upon with FDA
Additional patient safety data may be acquired through an open-label program
Sage received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for SAGE-547 in PPD in September, 2016. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to offer a potentially expedited development path and review for promising drug candidates, which includes increased interaction and guidance from the FDA. Sage achieved this regulatory designation based primarily on the positive results from the placebo-controlled 202A study of SAGE-547 in 21 patients with severe PPD. The trial met the primary endpoint of significant reduction in the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) score in the SAGE-547-treated group compared with placebo at 60 hours, with an effect that was maintained at similar magnitude through the 30-day follow-up period. SAGE-547 was generally well tolerated in the study. There were no deaths, serious adverse events or discontinuations due to adverse events.

About FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation

The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a drug candidate that is planned for use, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of Breakthrough Therapy Designation include the same benefits as Fast Track Designation, plus an organizational commitment involving FDA’s senior managers with more intensive guidance from the FDA. Breakthrough Therapy Designation does not change the standards for approval.

About Postpartum Depression

Postpartum depression (PPD) is an affective disorder impacting women after childbirth. PPD may have devastating consequences for a woman and for her family, which may include significant functional impairment, depressed mood and/or loss of interest in her newborn, and associated symptoms of depression such as loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, motor challenges, lack of concentration, loss of energy and poor self-esteem. Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death following childbirth. It is estimated that PPD affects 500,000 to 750,000 mothers in the US each year1,2. A subset of these are severe enough to require hospitalization. There are no approved therapies for PPD and there is a high unmet medical need for improved pharmacological therapy in PPD.

About SAGE-547

SAGE-547 is an allosteric modulator of both synaptic and extra-synaptic GABAA receptors. SAGE-547 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of postpartum depression (PPD). SAGE-547 is an intravenous agent evaluated in the PPD-202A trial, a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of SAGE-547 in the treatment of adult female patients with severe PPD. Following top-line results in July 2016, Sage initiated an expansion of the clinical program of SAGE-547 in PPD with two randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to explore dose-ranging of SAGE-547 in severe PPD patients and to evaluate SAGE-547 efficacy in moderate PPD patients. For more information about participating in these trials, please contact clinicaltrials@sagerx.com.

SAGE-547 is also being developed as an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE) in the global Phase 3 STATUS Trial. For more information about the STATUS Trial, please visit www.statustrial.com. SAGE-547 has been granted both Fast Track and orphan drug designations by the FDA for the treatment of SRSE.

developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain
and other conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) will not meet the previously announced October 14
prescription drug user fee act (PDUFA) date for ARYMO(TM) ER (morphine
sulfate).
  ""Today we were informed that the FDA has identified no particular issue with
our application for ARYMO ER and that the Agency is working on the product
label,"" said Bob Radie, president and chief executive officer. """"The FDA
indicated that they need more time as they have done with other
abuse-deterrent opioid NDAs, and confirmed that no additional scientific
information or data is needed for our application. We will continue to work
closely with the FDA to bring this important product to those living with
chronic pain and the healthcare professionals who treat them.""
  On August 4, 2016 an FDA Advisory Committee voted 18 to 1 for approval of
ARYMO ER and the Committee recommended ARYMO ER should be labeled as an
abuse-deterrent product by the intravenous, nasal and oral routes of abuse.
ARYMO ER is being developed for the management of pain severe enough to
require daily, around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which
alternative treatment options are inadequate. If approved, ARYMO ER would be
the first product developed using Egalet's proprietary Guardian(TM)
Technology--a physical and chemical barrier approach to abuse-deterrence
that results in tablets that are difficult to manipulate for the purpose of
misuse and abuse.
  About Egalet
  Egalet, a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company, is focused on
developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain
and other conditions. Egalet has two approved products: OXAYDO(R) (oxycodone
HCI, USP) tablets for oral use only --CII and SPRIX(R) (ketorolac
tromethamine) Nasal Spray. In addition, using its proprietary Guardian(TM)
Technology, Egalet is developing a pipeline of clinical-stage, product
candidates that are specifically designed to deter abuse by physical and
chemical manipulation. The lead programs, ARYMO(TM) ER, an abuse-deterrent,
extended-release, oral morphine formulation, and Egalet-002, an
abuse-deterrent, extended-release, oral oxycodone formulation, are being
developed for the management of pain severe enough to require daily,
around-the-clock, long-term opioid treatment and for which alternative
treatment options are inadequate. Egalet's Guardian Technology can be
applied broadly across different classes of pharmaceutical products and can
be used to develop combination products that include multiple active
pharmaceutical ingredients with similar or different release profiles. For

  Guardian(TM) Technology
  Egalet's Guardian Technology has many applications and has been used to
develop commonly abused prescription medications in an abuse-deterrent form.
Egalet's proprietary Guardian Technology is a polymer matrix tablet
technology that utilizes a novel application of the well characterized
manufacturing process of injection molding, which results in tablets with
controlled-release properties as well as physical and chemical features that
have been demonstrated to resist both common and rigorous methods of
manipulation. Guardian Technology results in tablets that are extremely
hard, very difficult to chew, resistant to particle size reduction, and
inhibit/block attempts at chemical extraction of the active pharmaceutical
ingredient. In addition, the technology results in a viscous hydrogel on
contact with liquid, making syringeability very difficult. These features
are important to address the risk of accidental misuse (e.g., chewing) in
patients with chronic pain, as well as intentional abuse using more rigorous
methods of manipulation.","Egalet Notified that FDA Will Not Meet PDUFA Goal Data for ARYMO ER   No additional scientific information or data requested by FDA   PR Newswire   WAYNE, Pa., Oct. 13, 2016   WAYNE, Pa., Oct. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Egalet Corporation (Nasdaq: EGLT) (""Egalet""), a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative treatments for pain and other conditions, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will not meet the previously announced October 14 prescription drug user fee act (PDUFA) date for ARYMO(TM) ER (morphine sulfate).

  PR Newswire
  DUBLIN, Oct. 28, 2016
  DUBLIN, Oct. 28, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Allergan plc (NYSE: AGN) announced
today that it has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) (Cyclosporine Ophthalmic
Emulsion) 0.05%, a preservative-free, multi-dose bottle offering the same
preservative-free formulation of RESTASIS since the launch in 2003.
RESTASIS(R) is the one and only prescription treatment FDA approved to help
patients with a type of Chronic Dry Eye make more of their own tears.
  Logo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20150612/222796LOGO
  RESTASIS(R) helps increase your eyes' natural ability to produce tears,
which may be reduced by inflammation due to Chronic Dry Eye. RESTASIS(R) did
not increase tear production in patients using anti-inflammatory eye drops
or tear duct plugs.
  ""RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) will be an important addition to the Allergan family
of dry eye products, as it will enable healthcare providers to offer an
additional option for those patients who may prefer their eye drops in a
multi-dose bottle versus single-use vials,"" said Neda Shamie, MD,
fellowship-trained cornea  and cataract specialist, of Advanced Vision Care,
of Los Angeles, Calif.
  RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) is designed with a patented unidirectional valve and
air filter technology that eliminates the need for a preservative. The new
multi-dose bottle uses less plastic than a package of single-use vials and
will be available for the same price.
  ""RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) exemplifies Allergan's commitment to innovation and
customer responsiveness,"" said David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer at
Allergan.  ""Through our Open Science model, we drive to deliver advancements
in highly engineered developments, such as the new multi-dose bottle.""
  About Chronic Dry Eye
  One type of chronic dry eye is caused by reduced tear production due to
inflammation. Dry eye is often a chronic disease that can be caused by
advanced age, contact lens wear, certain medications, eye diseases, other
medical conditions or environmental factors. Without enough tears, the film
protecting the eye can break down, creating dry spots on the cornea.
  About RESTASIS
  RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) Ophthalmic Emulsion help increase
your eyes' natural ability to produce tears, which may be reduced by
inflammation due to Chronic Dry Eye. RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM)
did not increase tear production in patients using anti-inflammatory eye
drops or tear duct plugs.
  Important Safety Information
  Do not use RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) Ophthalmic Emulsion if you
are allergic to any of the ingredients.  Be careful not to touch the
container tip to your eye or other surfaces, to help avoid eye injury and
contamination.  RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) should not be used
while wearing contact lenses. If contact lenses are worn, they should be
removed prior to use of RESTASIS(R) and RESTASIS MULTIDOSE(TM) and may be
reinserted after 15 minutes.
  The most common side effect is a temporary burning sensation. Other side
effects include eye redness, discharge, watery eyes, eye pain, foreign body
sensation, itching, stinging, and blurred vision.
  You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to
the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch, or call 1-800-FDA-1088.

increased expenses reflect structural changes that will impact our long-term

for the upcoming year. The company reaffirmed its financial expectations
through the remainder of the decade, including at least 5 percent average
annual revenue growth driven by volume and an increase in gross margin as a
percent of revenue, both on a constant currency basis. The company also
reaffirmed its commitment to achieve an OPEX-to-revenue ratio of 50 percent
or less in 2018, along with annual dividend increases for shareholders.
  ""As we move past the negative solanezumab data read-out, Lilly's
innovation-based strategy is generating strong momentum in multiple
therapeutic areas. Most recently we have received an important
cardiovascular indication for Jardiance, as well as U.S. approval and
conditional EU approval of Lartruvo, and we are awaiting global regulatory
decisions for baricitinib,"" said David A. Ricks, president of Lilly
Bio-Medicines and Lilly's incoming president and chief executive officer.
  Ricks added, ""We are already seeing substantial revenue from recently
launched products, including Trulicity and Cyramza, and we are pleased with
early uptake for Taltz. We remain confident that we could launch at least 20
new products in 10 years from 2014 through 2023, creating value for all
stakeholders in the company.""
  ""Because of our confidence in our future growth prospects, we are
reaffirming our financial commitments through the remainder of the decade,""
said Derica Rice, Lilly's executive vice president for global services and
chief financial officer. ""In 2017, we are expecting mid-single-digit revenue
growth driven by volume from recent product launches. By improving
productivity through prudent expense management, we expect to leverage this
top-line growth into double-digit earnings growth.""

Howard Schultz is stepping down as chief executive of the
Starbucks Corp so he can devote all of his time to a new strategic
initiative of opening high-end coffee shops for the 45-year-old company.
     Mr. Schultz, 63, is handing over the reins to President and Chief
Operating Officer Kevin Johnson, who served as a board member of the company
for several years before joining its executive team two years ago.
     Mr. Schultz will remain chairman of Starbucks and said he has no plans to
step away from the company or run for political office, as many have
speculated in the past due to his vocal stance on such issues as veterans'
rights and jobs creation.
     ""I don't have any time horizon that would limit my engagement in the
company,"" he said in an interview. ""This gives me the entrepreneurial
freedom to do what I think I do best.""
     The move is aimed at refreshing the Starbucks brand, which has been
facing increasing competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and
Intelligentsia as well as from mass coffee purveyors like Dunkin' Donuts,
which has been introducing more high-end drinks such as cold brewed coffee.
     Mr. Schultz said the approach could also help protect Starbucks from an
inevitable loss of traffic from people who order more goods online, instead
of making mall trips. He decided that opening high-end coffee shops that
would provide a luxurious experience would entice people to leave their
homes.
     Two years ago the company opened its first such store, the Seattle
Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee
is roasted and people can buy $12 cups of small-batch ""reserve"" coffees made
with a siphon brewing technique.
     Starbucks is planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores ,
including one twice its size in Shanghai next year. The company plans to
build up to 1,000 smaller stores similar to the Roastery, minus the on-site
roasting, under the ""Starbucks Reserve"" brand with a logo that consists of
just a gold star and the letter ""R.""
     Starbucks is also remodeling many of its stores with Reserve-branded
coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and
different brewing methods offered in the Reserve stores. The company also
plans to test out new drinks and food at those stores and then introduce
them in its traditional coffee shops that don't contain Reserve bars.
     Mr. Schultz has shepherded Starbucks through many changes since he joined
the coffee company in 1982 as its marketing director.
     After leaving the company after a dispute with its owners, Mr. Schultz in
1986 opened his own coffee shop, which he named Il Giornale, and later
bought the Starbucks retail unit from its owners. He renamed his shop
Starbucks and went on to expand the brand to more than 25,000 stores across
the globe.","     Starbucks Corp.

to make the most of its remaining operations following an agreement to sell
its commercial air-leasing operations.
     The lender, which reports third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, hired Boston
Consulting Group in the summer to review the bank's operations. The firm
already is pushing hard to implement cost-cutting plans announced earlier
this year.
     CIT Chief Executive Ellen Alemany confirmed Monday that the firm had
hired the outside consultant. It did so ""to assist us in developing
opportunities in our key lines of business that build on our expertise and
differentiation, and maximize shareholder value creation,"" she said.
     Ms. Alemany isn't expected to announce any initiatives from the review
imminently, a person familiar with the matter said. The lines of business
that could be affected haven't yet been decided and the review is broad
based, this person said.
     While banks routinely use consultants to help with a variety of tasks,
such a strategic review often leads to significant new profitability
initiatives. For instance, Dallas-based Comerica Inc. hired Boston
Consulting Group earlier this year and its advice contributed to major new
plans for expense cuts and revenue increases.
     CIT earlier this month agreed to sell its commercial-air leasing business
to Chinese conglomerate HNA Group's Avolon unit for about $4 billion. In
connection with that deal, the bank plans to return almost $3 billion to
shareholders from the sale with the potential for some more.
     That sale rid the bank of a business that had become problematic despite
its high yields on leases. After the air leasing sale, CIT will still have a
unique assortment of finance businesses. Many, like railcar leasing, date
back to the years before the financial crisis when CIT wasn't a bank.
     CIT still faces headwinds: Its return on tangible equity was 7% in 2015
versus an average 10.6% for peers, according to a bank presentation. The
bank's stock also trades at just 65% of book value.
     CIT says it is working to turn that around. In March, as Ms. Alemany
prepared to take over from outgoing CEO John Thain, she set a number of new
goals for the bank. These included a return on tangible equity of 10% and
$125 million worth of cost cuts by 2018.
     The lender plans to make a third of those cost cuts by the end of 2016.
""We are very focused on this initiative,"" Ms. Alemany said Monday.
     In one move that proved to be controversial with employees, the bank
recently removed the office plants to save on maintenance costs, people
familiar with the matter said.

reimbursement next year after receiving an unusual negative rating in a key
measure of Medicare quality, but it said the report wasn't a fair indication
of how its business is doing.
     The health insurer also boosted its guidance for the September quarter
and current year. Still, shares in the company tumbled 4.4% Wednesday
morning.
     Star-quality ratings for the 2018 plan year published Wednesday by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services show that the percentage of
Humana's July 31 membership in 4-star plans or higher declined to about 37%,
or 1.17 million members, from about 78%, or 2.15 million members, a year
ago.
     Humana has historically performed strongly in the star ratings, which are
tied to government bonus payments. Humana said its star ratings for the 2018
bonus year ""do not accurately reflect the company's actual performance under
the applicable star measures"" and that it intends to file for
reconsideration of certain ratings.
     Humana also said it was planning to take actions in the coming quarters
""to mitigate any potential negative impact of these published ratings on
star bonus revenues for 2018.""
     The company said it believes the decline is due to lower scores for
certain star measures as a result of its recently-ended program audit by
CMS.
     For fiscal 2016, which ends in December, the company now expects adjusted
earnings $9.50 a share, up from its previous guidance for $9.25 a share.
     Humana said the increase mostly owes to better-than-anticipated
performance in its Medicare Advantage business and its Healthcare Services
segment. For the quarter ended in September, the company raised its guidance
to $3.15 a share from $2.77 a share.

billion to settle a set of high-profile mortgage-securities probes stemming
from the financial crisis, according to people familiar with the matter, a
number that would rank among the largest of what other banks have paid to
resolve similar claims and is well above what investors have been expecting.

     The figure is described by people close to the negotiations between
Deutsche Bank and the government as preliminary, and they said it came up in
discussions between the bank and government lawyers in recent days. It
hasn't been previously disclosed. Deutsche Bank is expected to push back
strongly against it, the people said, and it is far from clear what the
final outcome will be.
     It is also unclear how much of that amount is proposed to be paid in
cash, and how much could be in consumer relief, as past deals have been
structured.
     The Justice Department routinely opens high-stakes civil settlement talks
with a tough posture, posing higher numbers than it might expect eventually
to win, even from banks eager to close long-running probes, lawyers involved
in current and similar negotiations say.
     A Deutsche Bank spokesman responded to questions about a settlement by
pointing to a July filing saying that the bank had started negotiations with
the Justice Department.
     Deutsche Bank hasn't said what it has set aside in anticipation of a
settlement. The bank held EUR5.5 billion ($6.2 billion) in total litigation
reserves as of June 30, and said it expected to set aside more before the
end of the year.
     Privately, Deutsche Bank lawyers have suggested that the bank views
between $2 billion and $3 billion as a reasonable cost to close out the
Justice Department's mortgage-related probe quickly, according to people
familiar with internal bank discussions and signals communicated to
investors. One factor in Deutsche Bank executives' thinking is that the
lender already paid $1.9 billion in 2013 to settle some U.S. claims tied to
mortgage-backed securities, some of the people said.
     A hefty settlement would be bad news for a clutch of big European lenders
who also face potential penalties or litigation in connection with a U.S.
crackdown on the selling and packaging of residential mortgage-backed
securities before 2008.
     Big U.S. banks have paid multibillion-dollar settlements for allegedly
misleading investors about the quality of such securities. The largest so
far has been $16.65 billion paid by Bank of America Corp. in 2014. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. agreed in April to a $5 billion deal that included a $2.4
billion cash penalty plus a pledge of $1.8 billion to help struggling
borrowers and communities hard hit by the 2008 collapse in home prices.
     The banks have been accused of bundling poorly-underwritten home loans
and selling them as safer securities than they knew them to be, ultimately
helping to fuel a bubble in rising home prices and exacerbating the
consequences of the subsequent collapse.
     Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley together paid
more than $23 billion in penalties and consumer help to settle claims.
     In all of these settlements, the banks acknowledged improper behavior.
     The European banks that remain under investigation and could face
penalties besides Deutsche Bank, include Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group
AG, UBS Group AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, according to bank
disclosures and people familiar with the matter. The banks haven't commented
on any potential settlements other than to say they are cooperating with the
investigations. Some have set aside money for mortgage investigations as
part of their broader legal provisions, without specifying allocations,
according to company filings.
     Lawyers working with various banks say they consider Deutsche Bank a test
case in this next round of anticipated settlements, which come at a
sensitive time for European banks already thin on capital and slogging
through job cuts and restructuring. Lawyers for both Deutsche Bank and
Barclays have met or are meeting with Justice Department officials this
month to discuss a potential pact, according to people familiar with the
talks. Some lawyers involved have expressed a desire to reach a deal by the
November presidential election, the people said.
     Barclays CEO Jes Staley and Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan have both said
they are eager to put big-ticket legal matters behind them.
     The apparent gulf between figures viewed as palatable to the bank and
those posed by Justice Department officials suggests negotiations could
still have a long way to go, and could ultimately lead to court battles, the
people said.
     Analysts have estimated Deutsche Bank alone might pay between $2 billion
and $5 billion, based on previous settlements with banks including Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and Deutsche Bank's relative size in the precrisis
market for packaging and selling residential-mortgage-backed securities.
     In June, Barclays banking analyst Jeremy Sigee estimated Deutsche Bank
might pay $4.5 billion, and Credit Suisse and UBS might each pay $2 billion.
He and other analysts have said settlements ultimately could push Deutsche
Bank and Credit Suisse toward capital hikes.
     Past settlements haven't always been tied directly to the size of the
business targeted. Citigroup, for example, paid a larger penalty than
expected based on its size in the market for residential-mortgage
securities. Officials said at the time it was commensurate with the strength
of evidence against the bank. Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
declined to comment.

  Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC (JAZZ) is nearing a deal to buy Celator
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPXX) for about $1.5 billion, a huge premium for a
company with a promising leukemia drug but no revenue.
  The deal could be announced as soon as Tuesday, according to people familiar
with the matter.
  Jazz would be shelling out roughly double Celator's market value of about
$740 million--a lofty premium even in biotechnology, where acquirers often
pay up for promising new treatments. Less than three months ago, Celator
announced positive results for a clinical trial of a leukemia drug.
  The therapy, Vyxeos, aims to treat a blood cancer known as acute myeloid
leukemia with two currently available drugs in a new formulation.
  In mid-March, Celator, of Ewing, N.J., released data indicating the drug
candidate prolonged the lives of patients. The news raised investors'
confidence that the compound would be approved, and Celator's share price
rose more than 400% in a single day.
  Celator subsequently sold new shares to raise money that it could use to
bring Vyxeos to market, if it is approved. But some analysts still
questioned whether the company, which doesn't have any revenue, would have
enough money to do that.
  Jazz has a market value of about $9 billion and had nearly $1 billon in cash
as of March 31. The company is headquartered in California but has a foreign
tax address, thanks to its 2012 acquisition of an Israeli drug company--a
so-called tax inversion that moved its legal home to Ireland.
  Such deals have been popular among drug companies, and many that struck them
around that time have since become voracious acquirers in the U.S.
  However, Jazz largely sat out the wave of consolidation in specialty
pharmaceuticals over the past two years. Its last major purchase was a 2014
deal for Gentium SpA, an Italian maker of drugs to treat rare diseases. Jazz
spent about $1 billion to acquire Gentium.
  But Wall Street has questioned what the company will do when its main
product, narcolepsy drug Xyrem, loses patent protection. Executives have
indicated they are interested in bulking up the company's portfolio of
cancer treatments, such as the one Celator is developing.
  Jazz already sells two drugs for cancer patients. One is Erwinaze, a
treatment for a blood cancer known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Jazz
recently began selling a new drug in the U.S., Defitelio, which treats a
rare but fatal complication of stem-cell transplants given to certain cancer
patients.
  Jazz shares are down about 15% over the past year, though they have
recovered somewhat from the broad selloff in pharmaceutical stocks last
summer. The company posted $1.3 billion in revenue last year, a 13% increase
over 2014.
  There's been a steady stream of deal making in biotech even as merger
activity amid big drug makers has slowed somewhat this year. Two weeks ago,
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) struck a $4.5 billion deal to buy Anacor Pharmaceuticals
Inc. (ANAC), which is currently seeking approval from the Food and Drug
Administration for an eczema treatment.

     Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. is in advanced talks to sell a
big stomach-drug business to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for about $10
billion, a move that could ease pressure on Valeant over its hefty debt
load.
     The companies could reach a deal for Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd., which
Valeant bought just a year-and-a-half ago, in the coming weeks, people
familiar with the matter said. The purchase price would include about $8.5
billion in cash and future royalty payments to Valeant, the people said.
There is no guarantee the companies will reach a deal and, indeed, there is
another unnamed potential bidder in the mix, according to a person familiar
with the matter.
     Should Valeant strike a deal, it would allow the company to largely pay
back its bank lenders, removing a big area of concern for investors ever
since the drugmaker became embroiled in an accounting scandal last year.
Valeant has told investors it would work to reduce its debt load, but the
company was expected to do so through a series of smaller steps.
     It would also likely allow Valeant's new chief executive, Joseph Papa, to
focus on rebuilding Valeant's core franchises in skin and eye drugs, which
include Bausch & Lomb brands, have been struggling.
     Salix makes treatments for stomach disorders like traveler's diarrhea and
irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS.
     For Takeda, the purchase would come after it lost out on earlier attempts
to buy Salix and deliver big-selling gastrointestinal drugs it has been
seeking to bolster its lineup of stomach remedies.

Inc., the struggling social-media service, people familiar with the matter
said.
     Twitter, with a stock-market value of nearly $20 billion, has also held
preliminary talks with Salesforce.com Inc., according to people familiar
with the matter.
     The sale process is in early stages and it is far from guaranteed that
anyone will end up buying Twitter.
     The takeover talks have been fueled by Twitter's sluggish growth in users
and revenue, perennial turnover among senior executives and a lack of
mission and business plan as focused as those of competitors like Facebook
Inc.
     Twitter shares rose 3.3% to $23.37 on Monday, after rising 21% on Friday
when news of Salesforce's interest emerged. Disney stock fell 1.4% to $91.96
a share on Monday.
     A Twitter acquisition would be Disney's biggest technology deal yet,
following recent investments in Hulu and Vice, among others.
     Recent moves by Twitter into streaming sports events online have
attracted the attention of Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger. In August,
the Burbank, Calif.,-based media giant said it was spending $1 billion for a
33% stake in BAMTech, a streaming-media company created by Major League
Baseball that Twitter is using to live stream sporting events.
     Since Disney owns ESPN, the media giant could view Twitter's
sports-programming efforts as creating a potential rival -- or, in the event
of a successful acquisition, it could be a source of technology that could
benefit ESPN as cord-cutting becomes more widespread.
     Mr. Iger offered a positive assessment of the BAMTech-Twitter partnership
in a question-and-answer session at an investor conference held by Goldman
Sachs earlier this month.
     ""I thought Twitter actually did a very good job,"" he said, referring to
one of the National Football League games that the site had hosted. ""That
platform was powered by BAMTech last week and will be, which I think says a
lot about that platform because it was very stable.""
     Disney's investment in BAMTech, which could eventually expand to a
majority stake, was seen by Wall Street as an olive branch after investor
concerns about slowing subscriber growth at the company's ESPN cable
channel.
     Mr. Iger described Twitter at the Goldman Sachs conference as a ""new
entrant"" in the arena of sports rights but also defended his own subsidiary.
""You have to think about monetization capabilities of these new entrants,""
he said. ""Nobody can monetize sports better than ESPN,"" he said.
     Twitter and Disney also have ties through Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, who
has served on the media company's board since 2013. He has looked to Mr.
Iger as a mentor, especially as Mr. Dorsey has had to wade through the
diverse demands of the two companies he co-founded and runs: Twitter and
payment company Square. In an interview last year, Mr. Iger told The Wall
Street Journal he occasionally counsels the younger CEO on business matters.
""I am not involved in his businesses, so I am a good sounding board for
him,"" Mr. Iger said.
     Disney's potential interest in Twitter was reported earlier by Bloomberg.

     Disney has a mixed record when it comes to acquiring technology companies
-- all of which have been much smaller than Twitter.
     In 2014, it paid an initial $500 million for Maker Studios, an online
video producer popular among younger viewers finding their entertainment on
YouTube Inc. An additional $450 million was promised if Maker met certain
performance targets, but Disney ended up paying only $175 million, according
to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
     Maker's CEO, Ynon Kreiz, left the company last year, and several other
high-ranking executives have departed since the Disney acquisition. Maker
announced it was laying off an unspecified number of workers earlier this
year.
     Not all Disney's tech acquisitions have been well-timed. Disney bought
the social-gaming company Playdom Inc. for $563 million in 2010, not long
before social games plummeted in popularity.
     Disney Interactive, the company's videogame and online-content division,
merged with Disney Consumer Products in 2015 following years of losses and
layoffs.
     It turned a corner to profitability following layoffs that eliminated a
quarter of its staff in 2014 and the launch of the ""Disney Infinity""
videogame. But in May, Disney announced it was booking a $147 million charge
and canceling the ""Infinity"" line, a move that cut between 250 and 300 jobs
and closed a studio in Utah.

     Twitter's struggles, alongside a deal-friendly climate in Silicon Valley,
have raised questions around Twitter's future as an independent public
company
     In the years since its November 2013 initial public offering, which was
priced at $26, Twitter has grappled with slow user expansion and shrinking
revenue growth. In its June quarter, Twitter reported 20% revenue growth,
its smallest gain to-date and eighth-straight period of declining growth.
     Since Chief Executive Jack Dorsey retook the helm in 2015, Twitter has
sought to reinvigorate its ads business around video and revive user growth
by making the short-messaging service he invented easier to use.
     Last October, the company released its Moments feature, which curates
tweets, photos and videos shared on the service around sporting events,
entertainment and breaking news, to help newcomers get pulled into the
service.
     Last week, Twitter introduced its first live-stream of a National
Football League game, with an average audience of 243,000 viewers a minute
watching the New York Jets beat the Buffalo Bills. Still, that paled in
comparison with the average of 15.4 million people who watched the game on
CBS and the NFL Network.
     The football game was one of the first major events for Twitter's
live-streaming strategy, the cornerstone of its plan to become the premier

capitalizing on its strength as a real-time service and the growing trend of
cord-cutting viewers. Twitter plans to also stream the presidential and vice

on market leaders AT&T Inc. and Verizon Communications Inc., but he
abandoned the effort after regulators signaled they would reject the plan.

the election and when a new chairman is appointed to the Federal

Wayne T. Hockmeyer,  Baxalta's Chairman, expected to become Deputy Chairman, and two additional Directors to be included from the Baxalta Board    


Shire plc (LSE: SHP, NASDAQ: SHPG) and Baxalta Incorporated (NYSE: BXLT) today announced that the boards of directors of both companies have reached an agreement under which Shire will combine with Baxalta. Under the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share.  Based on Shire's closing ADS price on January 8, 2016, this implies a total current value of $45.57 per Baxalta share, representing an aggregate consideration of approximately $32 billion. The exchange ratio is based on Shire's 30-day trading day volume weighted average ADS price of $199.03 as of January 8, 2016, which implies a total value of $47.50 per Baxalta share.

The value of the offer, as of Shire's January 8, 2016 closing ADS price, represents a premium of approximately 37.5% to Baxalta's unaffected share price on August 3, 2015, the day prior to the public announcement of Shire's initial offer for Baxalta. This will provide Baxalta shareholders with approximately 34% ownership in the combined company. The parties expect the transaction to close mid-2016.

Shire Chief Executive Officer Flemming Ornskov, M.D., M.P.H., commented:  

""This proposed combination allows us to realize our vision of building the leading biotechnology company focused on rare diseases. Together, we will have leadership positions in multiple, high-value franchises and become the clear partner of choice in rare diseases. Our expanded portfolio and presence in more than 100 countries will drive our growth to over $20 billion in anticipated annual revenues by 2020. Our due diligence has reinforced our belief in the combination, and we look forward to welcoming Baxalta colleagues to a shared entrepreneurial, patient-driven culture.""  


Susan Kilsby, Chairman of Shire, commented:  

""Together, Shire and Baxalta create a platform for sustainable innovation, growth and value creation. Shire is an experienced and disciplined acquirer with a track record of delivering shareholder value. Stakeholders of both companies are expected to benefit from the enhanced growth prospects, superior operational scale and efficiency and the strong financial and organizational profile of the combined entity.""

Baxalta Chief Executive Officer Ludwig N. Hantson, Ph.D., commented:  

""Today's announcement marks a new path forward for our organization and is a testament to the significant progress we have made in achieving our strategic business priorities. This transaction presents a unique opportunity for Baxalta shareholders, who will receive substantial immediate value as well as an ongoing stake in a combined global leader in rare diseases with strong growth prospects. We bring to Shire a strong portfolio and pipeline of market-leading products, high-quality manufacturing capabilities and a talented global workforce that places patients at the center of everything we do. The combined organization will be well positioned to accelerate innovation and deliver enhanced value for all stakeholders.""

Wayne T. Hockmeyer, Ph.D., Chairman of Baxalta, commented:  

""We launched Baxalta to focus on purpose-driven performance, sustainable growth, and continuing our leadership in developing treatments for orphan and underserved diseases. While we have made great progress to date and have had a measurable impact across all our businesses, I look forward to joining the board of the combined company to help ensure that we infuse the best of both organizations and foster a new shared culture that has the resources, the passion, and the commitment to continue to make a meaningful difference in the lives of our patients and their families.""

Baxter International Chairman and Chief Executive Officer José E. Almeida commented:  

""Baxter fully supports the proposed combination of Shire and Baxalta, which will create a major biotechnology company and global leader in rare diseases. Baxter is pleased to support this value enhancing transaction.""

Shire will host a conference call for investors and analysts today, January 11, 2016 at 1:30 p.m. GMT / 8:30 a.m. EST / 5:30 a.m. PST. (Details below)

Combination Creates the Global Leader in Rare Diseases with a Sustainable Platform for Future Innovation, Growth and Value Creation  

The combination of Baxalta and Shire will create the number one rare diseases platform in revenue and pipeline depth, with best-in-class products in each of the following growing, multi-billion-dollar franchises: Hematology; Immunology; Neuroscience; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Gastrointestinal / Endocrine; and Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).  The combined company will also possess a growing franchise in Oncology, with approved products and innovative compounds in development, as well as a robust late-stage Ophthalmics pipeline.

The combined portfolio will have an expanded range of therapeutic areas with more than 60 programs in development, including over 50 that will address rare diseases and the newly-approved Baxalta products ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and OBIZUR. Shire anticipates more than 30 recent and planned product launches from the combined pipeline, contributing approximately $5 billion in annual revenues by 2020.

Further, the combined company will benefit from expanded geographic reach across more than 100 countries, with a high-quality commercial organization and world-class manufacturing operations. Through a balanced portfolio and expanded therapeutic expertise and capabilities, the combination will enhance revenue diversification and optionality for the business, while strong cash flows will increase financial and operational scale. In total, the proposed combination will create a sustainable platform for future innovation and growth, yielding projected near- and long-term value for shareholders.

Leading Franchises, Each with Best-in-Class Products and a Foundation for Sustained Category Leadership in Rare Diseases  

The portfolio will include over 20 leading brands and a robust pipeline of expected new product launches with complementary positions across growing multi-billion-dollar franchises:  

Hematology   

Baxalta has a well-established hematology portfolio based on its heritage and legacy of leadership in hemophilia. Baxalta offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative therapeutics, including ADYNOVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated, an extended circulating half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A which was recently approved in the U.S., and is focused on introducing new treatments for hemophilia and other rare chronic bleeding disorders to further reduce patient burdens 


Immunology   

Baxalta is contributing the broadest portfolio of immunoglobulin (IG) products in the industry, most notably the recently launched HYQVIA, a next generation subcutaneous IG treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency, as well as a pipeline of innovative products across a broad range of potential new indications 


Neuroscience   

Shire has over 20 years of experience in neuroscience with a strong, growing ADHD franchise and pipeline, including a new VYVANSE indication for adults with moderate-to-severe Binge Eating Disorder 


Lysosomal Storage Diseases  

Shire brings industry-leading capabilities in the development and commercialization of a wide range of therapies for multiple rare and devastating genetic diseases including: VPRIV for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease; ELAPRASE for patients with Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II); and REPLAGAL for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease 


Gastrointestinal / Endocrine  

Shire's Gastrointestinal / Endocrine portfolio is built on the strength of its 5-ASA products, LIALDA, for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and PENTASA, for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, and recent additions of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, for adults with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support, and NATPARA, as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism 


HAE  

Shire brings HAE leadership through its currently approved prophylactic and acute therapies, CINRYZE and FIRAZYR, respectively,  and-pending completion of the Dyax acquisition-a Phase 3, potentially transformative prophylactic therapy 


Ophthalmics   

Shire is focused on building franchise leadership in ophthalmology with the 2016 projected launch of Lifitegrast, contingent upon regulatory approval, for dry eye disease; SHP640 for infectious conjunctivitis entering Phase 3 trials in 2016, and SHP607 for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, generating results from its Phase 2 trials which are expected in 2016 


Oncology  

Baxalta brings a growing oncology business and a broad platform that positions the combined company at the leading-edge of discovery and development of innovative therapies in hematological and other cancers. The portfolio includes ONCASPAR (pegaspargase), a marketed biologic treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and late-stage, partnered products such as pacritinib, an investigational oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, and ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection) for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer   


Financial Highlights  

Shire anticipates that it will realize more than $500 million in annual cost synergies (expected to be achieved within the first three years post-closing). These annual cost synergies will be achieved by increasing efficiencies, leveraging the scale of the combined business, aligning to Shire's lean operating model and optimizing the combined R&D portfolio. Further, Shire expects to generate additional revenue synergies and a combined non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16-17% by 2017. Growth is expected to be accelerated by combining capabilities and establishing a global infrastructure that will include a ""best of both"" commercial model and a presence in over 100 global markets.

The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted EPS in 2017, the first calendar year of ownership, and beyond. The combined company is expected to generate annual operating cash flow of $6.0 billion beginning in 2018, underpinning an attractive ROIC that will exceed Shire's cost of capital in 2020.

Shire has conducted additional tax due diligence, and based on this diligence, Shire and its tax advisor have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per Baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter.

Shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility to finance the combination. The new bank facility has a one year life, with a one-year extension available at Shire's option.  Shire intends to refinance the bank facility through capital market debt issuances in due course. The financing of the transaction has been structured with the intention of maintaining an investment grade credit rating for the combined entity. Shire is committed to de-levering rapidly post-close by deploying free cash flow to repay debt. Shire is targeting a net debt to EBITDA range of between 2.0x and 3.0x 12-18 months post-closing.

(Details below)  Combination Creates the Global Leader in Rare Diseases with a Sustainable Platform for Future Innovation, Growth and Value Creation    The combination of Baxalta and Shire will create the number one rare diseases platform in revenue and pipeline depth, with best-in-class products in each of the following growing, multi-billion-dollar franchises: Hematology; Immunology; Neuroscience; Lysosomal Storage Diseases; Gastrointestinal / Endocrine; and Hereditary Angioedema (HAE).  The combined company will also possess a growing franchise in Oncology, with approved products and innovative compounds in development, as well as a robust late-stage Ophthalmics pipeline.  The combined portfolio will have an expanded range of therapeutic areas with more than 60 programs in development, including over 50 that will address rare diseases and the newly-approved Baxalta products ADYNOVATE, VONVENDI and OBIZUR. Shire anticipates more than 30 recent and planned product launches from the combined pipeline, contributing approximately $5 billion in annual revenues by 2020.  Further, the combined company will benefit from expanded geographic reach across more than 100 countries, with a high-quality commercial organization and world-class manufacturing operations. Through a balanced portfolio and expanded therapeutic expertise and capabilities, the combination will enhance revenue diversification and optionality for the business, while strong cash flows will increase financial and operational scale. In total, the proposed combination will create a sustainable platform for future innovation and growth, yielding projected near- and long-term value for shareholders.  Leading Franchises, Each with Best-in-Class Products and a Foundation for Sustained Category Leadership in Rare Diseases    The portfolio will include over 20 leading brands and a robust pipeline of expected new product launches with complementary positions across growing multi-billion-dollar franchises:    Hematology     Baxalta has a well-established hematology portfolio based on its heritage and legacy of leadership in hemophilia. Baxalta offers a comprehensive portfolio of innovative therapeutics, including ADYNOVATE, Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant), PEGylated, an extended circulating half-life recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) treatment for hemophilia A which was recently approved in the U.S., and is focused on introducing new treatments for hemophilia and other rare chronic bleeding disorders to further reduce patient burdens    Immunology     Baxalta is contributing the broadest portfolio of immunoglobulin (IG) products in the industry, most notably the recently launched HYQVIA, a next generation subcutaneous IG treatment for patients with primary immunodeficiency, as well as a pipeline of innovative products across a broad range of potential new indications    Neuroscience     Shire has over 20 years of experience in neuroscience with a strong, growing ADHD franchise and pipeline, including a new VYVANSE indication for adults with moderate-to-severe Binge Eating Disorder    Lysosomal Storage Diseases    Shire brings industry-leading capabilities in the development and commercialization of a wide range of therapies for multiple rare and devastating genetic diseases including: VPRIV for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease; ELAPRASE for patients with Hunter syndrome (Mucopolysaccharidosis II, MPS II); and REPLAGAL for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Fabry disease    Gastrointestinal / Endocrine    Shire's Gastrointestinal / Endocrine portfolio is built on the strength of its 5-ASA products, LIALDA, for the treatment of mild to moderate ulcerative colitis, and PENTASA, for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis, and recent additions of GATTEX/REVESTIVE, for adults with short bowel syndrome who are dependent on parenteral support, and NATPARA, as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism    HAE    Shire brings HAE leadership through its currently approved prophylactic and acute therapies, CINRYZE and FIRAZYR, respectively,  and-pending completion of the Dyax acquisition-a Phase 3, potentially transformative prophylactic therapy    Ophthalmics     Shire is focused on building franchise leadership in ophthalmology with the 2016 projected launch of Lifitegrast, contingent upon regulatory approval, for dry eye disease; SHP640 for infectious conjunctivitis entering Phase 3 trials in 2016, and SHP607 for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity, generating results from its Phase 2 trials which are expected in 2016    Oncology    Baxalta brings a growing oncology business and a broad platform that positions the combined company at the leading-edge of discovery and development of innovative therapies in hematological and other cancers. The portfolio includes ONCASPAR (pegaspargase), a marketed biologic treatment for acute lymphocytic leukemia, and late-stage, partnered products such as pacritinib, an investigational oral kinase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with myelofibrosis, and ONIVYDE (irinotecan liposome injection) for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer      Financial Highlights    Shire anticipates that it will realize more than $500 million in annual cost synergies (expected to be achieved within the first three years post-closing). These annual cost synergies will be achieved by increasing efficiencies, leveraging the scale of the combined business, aligning to Shire's lean operating model and optimizing the combined R&D portfolio. Further, Shire expects to generate additional revenue synergies and a combined non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16-17% by 2017. Growth is expected to be accelerated by combining capabilities and establishing a global infrastructure that will include a ""best of both"" commercial model and a presence in over 100 global markets.  The transaction is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP diluted EPS in 2017, the first calendar year of ownership, and beyond. The combined company is expected to generate annual operating cash flow of $6.0 billion beginning in 2018, underpinning an attractive ROIC that will exceed Shire's cost of capital in 2020.  Shire has conducted additional tax due diligence, and based on this diligence, Shire and its tax advisor have concluded that a merger with the proposed cash consideration of $18 per Baxalta share will maintain the tax-free status of the Baxalta spinoff from Baxter.  Shire has secured an $18 billion fully underwritten bank facility to finance the combination. The new bank facility has a one year life, with a one-year extension available at Shire's option.  Shire intends to refinance the bank facility through capital market debt issuances in due course. The financing of the transaction has been structured with the intention of maintaining an investment grade credit rating for the combined entity. Shire is committed to de-levering rapidly post-close by deploying free cash flow to repay debt. Shire is targeting a net debt to EBITDA range of between 2.0x and 3.0x 12-18 months post-closing.  Transaction Details    Under the agreement, Baxalta shareholders will receive $18.00 in cash and 0.1482 Shire ADS per Baxalta share.

at-home testing.
  ""The combination of Alere and Abbott will create the world's premier point
of care testing business and significantly strengthen and grow Abbott's
diagnostics presence,"" said Miles D. White, chairman and chief executive
officer, Abbott. ""We want to offer our customers the best and broadest

billion in sales are in the U.S. Alere also has a growing presence in key
international markets, where Abbott's capabilities and infrastructure will
drive accelerated growth of Alere's portfolio.
  ""Today's announcement marks an exciting and transformative milestone for
Alere and one that provides an immediate benefit for our stockholders,"" said
Namal Nawana, president and chief executive officer, Alere. ""Our leading
platforms and global presence in point-of-care diagnostics, combined with
Abbott's broad portfolio of market-leading products, will accelerate our
shared goal of improving patient care. I'd like to thank our global
workforce of nearly 10,000 employees whose hard work and dedication has
enabled Alere to contribute to improved patient outcomes throughout the
world.""

2018.* The combination is anticipated to result in annual pre-tax synergies
approaching $500 million by 2019 and increasing thereafter, including both
sales and operational benefits.

common share in cash at the completion of the transaction, and Alere will
become a subsidiary of Abbott. Alere's net debt, currently $2.6 billion,

  Point of Care Testing
  Point of care testing helps improve outcomes and increase the speed of care
by bringing the test results to the physician and patient's side in a matter
of minutes. The demand for point of care testing is accelerating as health
care providers and consumers look for better ways to get fast, accurate and
actionable information to guide decision-making. In fact, point of care
testing is a $5.5 billion segment and one of the fastest growing in vitro
diagnostics segments, in part because many health care systems are
increasing their reliance on these technologies to inform patient care
decisions because of their ease of use, speed and accuracy.

  Headquartered in Waltham, Mass., Alere is the global leader in point of care
diagnostics with annual sales of $2.5 billion. Alere delivered more than 1.4

molecular, cardiometabolic and toxicology. In addition to tests for
infections such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and dengue that can benefit
people in remote care settings, Alere develops simple, rapid tests,
including Alere i, the first molecular CLIA-waived test for flu and strep,
that delivers results in under 15 minutes.
  About Abbott's Diagnostics Business
  Abbott is a global leader in in vitro diagnostics offering a broad portfolio
spanning immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, blood screening,

Cash offer of $9.50 per share
All equity transaction supported by well-capitalized consortium
Will continue to invest in strategic transformation, enhancing student outcomes and career relevant education for working adults
Apollo Education Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: APOL) today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of investors including The Vistria Group, LLC, funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (NYSE: APO), and Najafi Companies for $9.50 per share in cash for both Class A and B shares. The purchase price represents a premium of 30 percent over Apollo Education Group’s 30-day volume weighted average stock price for the period ended Feb. 5, 2016, and a 44 percent premium over the closing price on Jan. 8, 2016, immediately prior to the announcement that the Board of Directors was pursuing strategic alternatives. Tony Miller, Chief Operating Officer and Partner of The Vistria Group and former Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Education, will become Chairman of the Apollo Education Group Board upon transaction close.

“The Apollo Education Group Board of Directors reviewed strategic alternatives and believes this transaction is in the best interest of all shareholders and strongly supports our transformation efforts,” said Greg Cappelli, Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Education Group. “This new structure will allow Apollo Education Group the flexibility and runway it needs to complete the transformational plan at University of Phoenix, which will enable us to serve our students more effectively during a period of unprecedented volatility within our industry. We will also continue to expand our international operations and remain committed to driving principles of operating excellence.”

“We are excited by the opportunity to build on the transformational work being done by the company,” said Miller. “For too long and too often, the private education industry has been characterized by inadequate student outcomes, overly aggressive marketing practices, and poor compliance. This doesn’t need to be the case. We are committed to accelerating and enhancing efforts to establish University of Phoenix as the leading provider of quality higher education for working adults and to continue supporting the organization’s commitment to operating in a manner consistent with the highest ethical standards.”

Miller was the Deputy Secretary and Chief Operating Officer at the U.S. Department of Education from 2009 to 2013. Miller oversaw day-to-day operations for a broad range of management, policy and program functions, spanning early childhood through post-secondary education. In addition to his operational responsibilities, Miller represented the U.S. Government at education and workforce development international forums and led the Department’s missions to China, Korea, Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Australia, New Zealand, Ecuador, Brazil and Russia.

Upon completion of the transaction, Apollo Education Group will be privately held and its affiliated institutions will remain subject to the same U.S. and international regulations and accreditation standards.

The agreement was approved by Apollo Education Group’s Board of Directors. The transaction is subject to financial, operational and customary closing conditions. It is also subject to regulatory conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart‐Scott‐Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, and approvals, including by the U.S. Department of Education, the Higher Learning Commission and state regulatory and programmatic accreditation bodies. In addition, it is subject to approval by a majority of Apollo Education Group Class A and B stockholders, voting as separate classes. Each of Apollo Education Group’s Class B stockholders has entered into an agreement to vote in favor of the transaction. The acquisition is expected to be completed by Apollo Education Group’s fiscal year-end, in August 2016. Apollo Education Group and Apollo Global Management are unaffiliated entities.

Barclays, Credit Suisse and Evercore are acting as financial advisors, and Sullivan & Cromwell LLP as legal advisor to Apollo Education Group. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is acting as legal advisor to the consortium of investors.

become CEO of the combined company and retain majority control. The Los
Angeles-based company is acquiring all the Morgans brands and ownership of
the Hudson and the Delano properties.
     Morgans owns or operates 13 boutique hotels, including New York's Hudson,
the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach. The combined
company will own or operate 20 hotels, including properties under the

  Stockholders to receive $14.00 per share in cash
  Transaction has total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion
  PR Newswire
  ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016
  ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Corporation (NYSE:
TLN), a competitive energy and power generation company that owns or
controls 16,000 megawatts of capacity in eight states, announced today that
it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with affiliates of
Riverstone Holdings LLC (""Riverstone""), a private investment firm.
  Under terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of Talen Energy
common stock not currently owned by Riverstone affiliated entities will be
acquired for $14.00 per share in cash. Affiliates of Riverstone currently
own approximately 35 percent of the outstanding shares of Talen Energy
common stock, which were issued in the June 2015 transaction that
established Talen Energy by combining competitive generation assets that had
been owned by affiliates of PPL Corporation and affiliates of Riverstone.
  The purchase price represents a 56 percent premium to the closing price of
$9.00 per share on March 31, 2016, the last trading day before public
reports of a potential sale of Talen Energy, and a 101 percent premium to
the 60-day volume-weighted average price of $6.95 per share through March
31.
  The transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion.
  ""We believe the transaction offers compelling value to our stockholders,
while eliminating execution risk, and will provide additional momentum to
the outstanding work our employees have done to drive improvements in the
safety, reliability and efficiency of our plants in the time since we became
an independent company,"" said Paul Farr, Talen Energy President and Chief
Executive Officer.
  ""The disinterested directors of the Board, not including the two Riverstone
directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors,
carefully analyzed Riverstone's offer, and after extensive negotiation and
thorough consideration, concluded that the agreement we are announcing today
is in the best interests of our stockholders,"" said Stuart E. Graham,
Chairman of Talen Energy's Board of Directors.
  David M. Leuschen and Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr., co-founders of Riverstone,
added, ""As an experienced owner of power generation assets, Riverstone is
excited to acquire Talen Energy and its world class generating fleet, which
is located in some of the United States' most attractive power markets.""
  'Go Shop'
  The agreement provides for a ""go-shop"" period, during which Talen Energy --
with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors -- may actively
solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with
parties that offer alternative proposals. The go-shop period is 40 days.
Talen Energy will be permitted to continue discussions with certain parties
that make a qualifying offer during the go-shop period for an additional 20
days and, subject to customary requirements included in the agreement, enter
into or recommend a transaction with a person or group that makes a superior
proposal. The agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee by
Talen Energy to Riverstone in the event that the agreement is terminated for
a superior proposal, which termination fee will be $50 million, but which
will be reduced to $25 million if Talen Energy accepts a superior proposal
made during the go-shop period.
  There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior
proposal. Talen Energy does not intend to disclose developments during this
process unless and until the Board makes a decision with respect to any
superior proposal it may receive.
  Stockholder and Regulatory Approval
  In addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of
outstanding shares of common stock, the transaction is subject to approval
by a majority of non- Riverstone affiliated stockholders voting at a special
stockholder meeting to be scheduled. Riverstone and its affiliates have
agreed to vote their 35 percent stake in favor of the proposed transaction.
  The transaction is subject to expiration of the applicable waiting period
under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, approval of the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
as well as certain other customary regulatory approvals and other customary
closing conditions. Riverstone's obligation to consummate the transaction is
also subject to Talen Energy having a minimum amount of cash and revolving
credit facility capacity available at closing.
  The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of
2016.
  Transaction Financing
  The consideration for the common stock in the transaction, of approximately
$1.8 billion, is expected to be funded by a conversion of Riverstone's
existing ownership of 35 percent of the common stock of Talen into shares of
the surviving corporation, Talen Energy's cash on hand, and proceeds of a
$250 million new secured term loan.  The new secured term loan is fully
committed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank
plc, Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Morgan Stanley Senior
Funding Inc., and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and will rank
pari-passu with the existing first lien revolving credit facility of Talen
Energy Supply LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy) (""Energy
Supply""), which will be reduced from $1.85 billion to $1.4 billion upon
closing of the transaction. Concurrently with the signing of the merger
agreement, all of Energy Supply's subsidiaries that currently guarantee its
revolving credit facility have executed guarantees (effective as of the
closing of the transaction) of Talen Energy's outstanding unsecured notes
due 2025 (""2025 Notes"") and its Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing
Authority revenue bonds (""Municipal Bonds""), which together comprise
approximately $831 million of Energy Supply's approximately $3.3 billion
total unsecured debt that will remain outstanding. As a result of this new
credit support for the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds, it is expected
that these notes and bonds will be structurally senior to the non-guaranteed
unsecured debt of Energy Supply, and we believe that the issue ratings on
the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds will be maintained or improved.
  Financial and Legal Advisors
  Citi is serving as financial advisor to Talen Energy. Kirkland & Ellis LLP
is serving as Talen Energy's legal advisor. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and RBC
Capital Markets are serving as financial advisors to Riverstone. Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are serving as Riverstone's
legal advisors for the transaction.

"," Talen Energy to be Acquired by Riverstone   Stockholders to receive $14.00 per share in cash   Transaction has total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion   PR Newswire   ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016   ALLENTOWN, Pa., June 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Talen Energy Corporation (NYSE: TLN), a competitive energy and power generation company that owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of capacity in eight states, announced today that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement with affiliates of Riverstone Holdings LLC (""Riverstone""), a private investment firm.   Under terms of the merger agreement, all outstanding shares of Talen Energy common stock not currently owned by Riverstone affiliated entities will be acquired for $14.00 per share in cash. Affiliates of Riverstone currently own approximately 35 percent of the outstanding shares of Talen Energy common stock, which were issued in the June 2015 transaction that established Talen Energy by combining competitive generation assets that had been owned by affiliates of PPL Corporation and affiliates of Riverstone.   The purchase price represents a 56 percent premium to the closing price of $9.00 per share on March 31, 2016, the last trading day before public reports of a potential sale of Talen Energy, and a 101 percent premium to the 60-day volume-weighted average price of $6.95 per share through March 31.   The transaction has a total enterprise value of approximately $5.2 billion.   ""We believe the transaction offers compelling value to our stockholders, while eliminating execution risk, and will provide additional momentum to the outstanding work our employees have done to drive improvements in the safety, reliability and efficiency of our plants in the time since we became an independent company,"" said Paul Farr, Talen Energy President and Chief Executive Officer.   ""The disinterested directors of the Board, not including the two Riverstone directors, with the assistance of our financial and legal advisors, carefully analyzed Riverstone's offer, and after extensive negotiation and thorough consideration, concluded that the agreement we are announcing today is in the best interests of our stockholders,"" said Stuart E. Graham, Chairman of Talen Energy's Board of Directors.   David M. Leuschen and Pierre F. Lapeyre, Jr., co-founders of Riverstone, added, ""As an experienced owner of power generation assets, Riverstone is excited to acquire Talen Energy and its world class generating fleet, which is located in some of the United States' most attractive power markets.""   'Go Shop'   The agreement provides for a ""go-shop"" period, during which Talen Energy -- with the assistance of its legal and financial advisors -- may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals. The go-shop period is 40 days. Talen Energy will be permitted to continue discussions with certain parties that make a qualifying offer during the go-shop period for an additional 20 days and, subject to customary requirements included in the agreement, enter into or recommend a transaction with a person or group that makes a superior proposal. The agreement provides for the payment of a termination fee by Talen Energy to Riverstone in the event that the agreement is terminated for a superior proposal, which termination fee will be $50 million, but which will be reduced to $25 million if Talen Energy accepts a superior proposal made during the go-shop period.   There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. Talen Energy does not intend to disclose developments during this process unless and until the Board makes a decision with respect to any superior proposal it may receive.   Stockholder and Regulatory Approval   In addition to approval by stockholders representing a majority of outstanding shares of common stock, the transaction is subject to approval by a majority of non- Riverstone affiliated stockholders voting at a special stockholder meeting to be scheduled. Riverstone and its affiliates have agreed to vote their 35 percent stake in favor of the proposed transaction.   The transaction is subject to expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, approval of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as well as certain other customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Riverstone's obligation to consummate the transaction is also subject to Talen Energy having a minimum amount of cash and revolving credit facility capacity available at closing.   The parties currently expect the transaction to be completed by the end of 2016.   Transaction Financing   The consideration for the common stock in the transaction, of approximately $1.8 billion, is expected to be funded by a conversion of Riverstone's existing ownership of 35 percent of the common stock of Talen into shares of the surviving corporation, Talen Energy's cash on hand, and proceeds of a $250 million new secured term loan.  The new secured term loan is fully committed by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Royal Bank of Canada, Barclays Bank plc, Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding Inc., and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and will rank pari-passu with the existing first lien revolving credit facility of Talen Energy Supply LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Talen Energy) (""Energy Supply""), which will be reduced from $1.85 billion to $1.4 billion upon closing of the transaction. Concurrently with the signing of the merger agreement, all of Energy Supply's subsidiaries that currently guarantee its revolving credit facility have executed guarantees (effective as of the closing of the transaction) of Talen Energy's outstanding unsecured notes due 2025 (""2025 Notes"") and its Pennsylvania Economic Development Financing Authority revenue bonds (""Municipal Bonds""), which together comprise approximately $831 million of Energy Supply's approximately $3.3 billion total unsecured debt that will remain outstanding. As a result of this new credit support for the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds, it is expected that these notes and bonds will be structurally senior to the non-guaranteed unsecured debt of Energy Supply, and we believe that the issue ratings on the 2025 Notes and the Municipal Bonds will be maintained or improved.   Financial and Legal Advisors   Citi is serving as financial advisor to Talen Energy. Kirkland & Ellis LLP is serving as Talen Energy's legal advisor. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and RBC Capital Markets are serving as financial advisors to Riverstone. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Vinson & Elkins LLP are serving as Riverstone's legal advisors for the transaction.   About Talen Energy   Talen Energy is one of the largest competitive energy and power generation companies in North America. The company owns or controls 16,000 megawatts of generating capacity in well-developed, structured wholesale power markets, principally in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and Southwest regions of the United States.

The combination of Envision and AMSURG brings together two leading, complementary healthcare companies to form one of the nation’s largest provider organizations, well positioned to help shape the future of healthcare delivery. Together, the companies manage a broad continuum of clinical network solutions, including outsourced physician services in the following specialties: emergency, hospitalist, anesthesia, radiology and children’s services. In addition, the companies provide solutions for ambulatory surgery, post-acute care and medical transportation. The two companies had combined revenue of more than $8.5 billion and Adjusted EBITDA of more than $1.1 billion for the 12 months ended March 31, 2016.

We are excited for the future and look forward to the opportunity to combine the resources of Envision and AMSURG.”

Mr. Holden added, “This merger will create a national platform with a highly differentiated suite of solutions. It will significantly increase our ability to empower physicians and expand our client relationships. Within a highly fragmented marketplace, we will have the critical first mover advantage to capitalize on the greenfield and cross-selling opportunities across our various offerings, and generate significant value for our shareholders.”

(“OceanFirst”) (NASDAQ:OCFC), headquartered in Toms River, New Jersey, and Ocean Shore Holding Co. (“Ocean Shore”) (NASDAQ:OSHC), headquartered in Ocean City, New Jersey, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Ocean Shore, the holding company and parent of Ocean City Home Bank, will merge with and into OceanFirst, the holding company and parent of OceanFirst Bank. Ocean City Home Bank will also merge with and into OceanFirst Bank. The transaction is valued at approximately $22.47 per Ocean Shore common share or approximately $145.6 million in the aggregate.


Ocean Shore Logo.jpg 
 


 

With roots dating back to 1887, Ocean City Home Bank is one of Southern New Jersey’s oldest and largest community banks with approximately $1.1 billion in total assets, $818 million in total deposits and $796 million in gross loans. Ocean Shore operates 11 full-service banking centers in Atlantic and Cape May Counties. Following OceanFirst’s recently completed acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc., the proposed transaction will further enrich OceanFirst’s distribution, scale and core deposit funding base, as it presents an exceptionally rare opportunity to combine two well-established, like-minded New Jersey franchises.

OceanFirst will strengthen its position as the largest bank headquartered in Central and Southern New Jersey and rank as the fourth largest New Jersey based banking institution by deposit market share.  Based on financial information as of March 31, 2016, and pro forma for the Cape transaction, the combined institution would have approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $4.0 billion in total deposits, $4.0 billion in gross loans and 61 full-service banking locations.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, upon completion of the merger, shareholders of Ocean Shore common stock will be entitled to receive $4.35 in cash and 0.9667 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each share of Ocean Shore common stock. The transaction is expected to close late fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.

The purchase price equates to 132% of Ocean Shore’s March 31, 2016 tangible book value, 4.9% premium to core deposits, 20.1x Ocean Shore’s trailing twelve month earnings, and 9.3x Ocean Shore’s estimated 2017 (forward) earnings (assuming fully phased-in cost savings). Tangible book value per common share is expected to be diluted by approximately 3.1% at closing with a projected earnback period of approximately 3.7 years using the cross-over1 method.

The transaction includes strong earnings per share accretion of approximately 5.4% in 2018 (the first full year of combined operations and synergies) in addition to the projected double-digit earnings accretion from the Cape Bancorp, Inc. transaction. The combined company will be structured to support enhanced financial return targets of greater than 1.05% return on average assets and greater than 13.0% return on average tangible common equity along with remaining “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.

OceanFirst expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $19 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 53% of Ocean Shore’s non-interest expenses or $12.4 million if 2017 cost savings were to be fully phased in. 

“We are excited to welcome Ocean City Home Bank customers and employees to the OceanFirst family. Our two institutions have developed our respective community banks with a consistent vision, effectively sharing similar histories.  With our mutual understanding of our community bank business models and local market focus, OceanFirst and Ocean Shore can leverage this synergy to create one of the most highly valued banking institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region,” said Christopher D. Maher, President and Chief Executive Officer of OceanFirst.

Mr. Maher further commented, “This transaction represents a unique opportunity for OceanFirst to capitalize on its recent entry into Southern New Jersey through the acquisition of an extremely valuable deposit franchise coupled with significant efficiencies and low execution risk. Ocean Shore’s residential focus creates strategic optionality for prudent commercial real estate growth with strong cash flows.  We look forward to continuing to provide extraordinary customer care to all OceanFirst and Ocean Shore customers, as well as providing enhanced value to our stockholders.”

Steven E. Brady, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Shore, echoed Mr. Maher’s comments stating, “The combination with OceanFirst provides several strategic benefits for all Ocean Shore stakeholders, including improved operating scale, access to additional product lines and increased shareholder liquidity.”  Mr. Brady added that “while this merger solidifies the pro forma bank’s Jersey Shore dominance, it also provides Ocean Shore the opportunity to capitalize on OceanFirst’s considerable expansion efforts toward the demographically attractive Philadelphia metro market - a natural market extension for Ocean Shore’s franchise as well.”

To provide for additional representation for OceanFirst’s Southern New Jersey market area, upon completion of the transaction, three current Ocean Shore Board members are expected to join the OceanFirst Board, including Mr. Brady.  Mr. Brady will also be named Vice Chairman for the Southern New Jersey Division, to serve in an advisory capacity for OceanFirst, where he will provide insight from his extensive banking and professional experience. 

Piper Jaffray & Co. is serving as financial advisor to OceanFirst and rendered a fairness opinion to OceanFirst’s Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel to OceanFirst. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. is serving as financial advisor to Ocean Shore and rendered a fairness opinion to Ocean Shore’s Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP is serving as legal counsel to Ocean Shore.

","TOMS RIVER, N.J. and OCEAN CITY, N.J., July 13, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. (“OceanFirst”) (NASDAQ:OCFC), headquartered in Toms River, New Jersey, and Ocean Shore Holding Co. (“Ocean Shore”) (NASDAQ:OSHC), headquartered in Ocean City, New Jersey, jointly announced today that they have entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Ocean Shore, the holding company and parent of Ocean City Home Bank, will merge with and into OceanFirst, the holding company and parent of OceanFirst Bank. Ocean City Home Bank will also merge with and into OceanFirst Bank. The transaction is valued at approximately $22.47 per Ocean Shore common share or approximately $145.6 million in the aggregate.   Ocean Shore Logo.jpg         With roots dating back to 1887, Ocean City Home Bank is one of Southern New Jersey’s oldest and largest community banks with approximately $1.1 billion in total assets, $818 million in total deposits and $796 million in gross loans. Ocean Shore operates 11 full-service banking centers in Atlantic and Cape May Counties. Following OceanFirst’s recently completed acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc., the proposed transaction will further enrich OceanFirst’s distribution, scale and core deposit funding base, as it presents an exceptionally rare opportunity to combine two well-established, like-minded New Jersey franchises.  OceanFirst will strengthen its position as the largest bank headquartered in Central and Southern New Jersey and rank as the fourth largest New Jersey based banking institution by deposit market share.  Based on financial information as of March 31, 2016, and pro forma for the Cape transaction, the combined institution would have approximately $5.3 billion in total assets, $4.0 billion in total deposits, $4.0 billion in gross loans and 61 full-service banking locations.  Under the terms of the merger agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies, upon completion of the merger, shareholders of Ocean Shore common stock will be entitled to receive $4.35 in cash and 0.9667 shares of OceanFirst common stock for each share of Ocean Shore common stock. The transaction is expected to close late fourth quarter of 2016 or early first quarter of 2017, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and fulfillment of other customary closing conditions.  The purchase price equates to 132% of Ocean Shore’s March 31, 2016 tangible book value, 4.9% premium to core deposits, 20.1x Ocean Shore’s trailing twelve month earnings, and 9.3x Ocean Shore’s estimated 2017 (forward) earnings (assuming fully phased-in cost savings). Tangible book value per common share is expected to be diluted by approximately 3.1% at closing with a projected earnback period of approximately 3.7 years using the cross-over1 method.  The transaction includes strong earnings per share accretion of approximately 5.4% in 2018 (the first full year of combined operations and synergies) in addition to the projected double-digit earnings accretion from the Cape Bancorp, Inc. transaction. The combined company will be structured to support enhanced financial return targets of greater than 1.05% return on average assets and greater than 13.0% return on average tangible common equity along with remaining “well-capitalized” under regulatory guidelines.  OceanFirst expects to incur pre-tax merger and integration costs of approximately $19 million and to achieve cost savings of approximately 53% of Ocean Shore’s non-interest expenses or $12.4 million if 2017 cost savings were to be fully phased in.   “We are excited to welcome Ocean City Home Bank customers and employees to the OceanFirst family. Our two institutions have developed our respective community banks with a consistent vision, effectively sharing similar histories.  With our mutual understanding of our community bank business models and local market focus, OceanFirst and Ocean Shore can leverage this synergy to create one of the most highly valued banking institutions in the Mid-Atlantic region,” said Christopher D. Maher, President and Chief Executive Officer of OceanFirst.  Mr. Maher further commented, “This transaction represents a unique opportunity for OceanFirst to capitalize on its recent entry into Southern New Jersey through the acquisition of an extremely valuable deposit franchise coupled with significant efficiencies and low execution risk. Ocean Shore’s residential focus creates strategic optionality for prudent commercial real estate growth with strong cash flows.  We look forward to continuing to provide extraordinary customer care to all OceanFirst and Ocean Shore customers, as well as providing enhanced value to our stockholders.”  Steven E. Brady, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocean Shore, echoed Mr. Maher’s comments stating, “The combination with OceanFirst provides several strategic benefits for all Ocean Shore stakeholders, including improved operating scale, access to additional product lines and increased shareholder liquidity.”  Mr. Brady added that “while this merger solidifies the pro forma bank’s Jersey Shore dominance, it also provides Ocean Shore the opportunity to capitalize on OceanFirst’s considerable expansion efforts toward the demographically attractive Philadelphia metro market - a natural market extension for Ocean Shore’s franchise as well.”  To provide for additional representation for OceanFirst’s Southern New Jersey market area, upon completion of the transaction, three current Ocean Shore Board members are expected to join the OceanFirst Board, including Mr. Brady.  Mr. Brady will also be named Vice Chairman for the Southern New Jersey Division, to serve in an advisory capacity for OceanFirst, where he will provide insight from his extensive banking and professional experience.   Piper Jaffray & Co. is serving as financial advisor to OceanFirst and rendered a fairness opinion to OceanFirst’s Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is serving as legal counsel to OceanFirst. Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P. is serving as financial advisor to Ocean Shore and rendered a fairness opinion to Ocean Shore’s Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP is serving as legal counsel to Ocean Shore.   Conference Call  OceanFirst will host a conference call to discuss the transaction on Wednesday, July 13, 2016 at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

Oil Search transaction terminated
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) and InterOil Corporation (NYSE: IOC, POMSoX: IOC) today announced an agreed transaction worth more than $2.5 billion, under which ExxonMobil will acquire all of the outstanding shares of InterOil (the ExxonMobil Transaction).

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160721006048/en/

“This agreement will enable ExxonMobil to create value for the shareholders of both companies and the people of Papua New Guinea,” said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation.

“InterOil’s resources will enhance ExxonMobil’s already successful business in Papua New Guinea and bolster the company’s strong position in liquefied natural gas.”

InterOil Chairman Chris Finlayson said, “Our board of directors thoroughly reviewed the ExxonMobil transaction and concluded that it delivers superior value to InterOil shareholders. They will also benefit from their interest in ExxonMobil’s diverse asset base and dividend stream.”

Under the terms of the agreement with ExxonMobil, InterOil shareholders will receive:

A payment of $45.00 per share of InterOil, paid in ExxonMobil shares, at closing. The number of ExxonMobil shares paid per share of InterOil will be calculated based on the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of ExxonMobil shares over a measuring period of 10 days ending shortly before the closing date (Share Consideration).
A Contingent Resource Payment (CRP), which will be an additional cash payment of $7.07 per share for each trillion cubic feet equivalent (tcfe) gross resource certification of the Elk-Antelope field above 6.2 tcfe, up to a maximum of 10 tcfe. The CRP will be paid on the completion of the interim certification process in accordance with the Share Purchase Agreement with Total SA, which will include the Antelope-7 appraisal well, scheduled to be drilled later in 2016. The CRP will not be transferrable and will not be listed on any exchange.
Together the Share Consideration and the CRP represent a material premium to the closing price of InterOil shares on May 19, 2016 -- the day prior to the announcement of the Oil Search transaction -- based on a range of Elk-Antelope resource estimates:

Based on InterOil’s 1-month VWAP up to and including May 19, 2016 of US$31.88 per share.
4
Based on InterOil’s 3-month VWAP up to and including May 19, 2016 of US$30.37 per share.
 
Compelling Benefits of the Transaction

When concluded, this transaction will give ExxonMobil access to InterOil’s resource base, which includes interests in six licenses in Papua New Guinea covering about four million acres, including PRL 15. The Elk-Antelope field in PRL 15 is the anchor field for the proposed Papua LNG project.

ExxonMobil’s more than 40 years of experience in the global LNG business enables it to efficiently link complex elements such as resource development, pipelines, liquefaction plants, shipping and regasification terminals, which it has demonstrated through the PNG LNG project, working closely with co-venturers, national, provincial and local governments, and local communities. ExxonMobil will bring to bear its industry-leading performance and strong commitment to excellence as it grows its business in Papua New Guinea.

The PNG LNG project, the first of its kind in the country, was developed by ExxonMobil in challenging conditions on budget and ahead of schedule and is now exceeding production design capacity, demonstrating the company’s leadership in project management and operations.

ExxonMobil will work with co-venturers and the government to evaluate processing of gas from the Elk-Antelope field by expanding the PNG LNG project. This would take advantage of synergies offered by expansion of an existing project to realize time and cost reductions that would benefit the PNG Treasury, the government’s holding in Oil Search, other shareholders and landowners.

Path to Completion

The ExxonMobil Transaction has been unanimously approved by the boards of both companies. The InterOil board unanimously recommends that InterOil shareholders approve the ExxonMobil Transaction.

The ExxonMobil Transaction will be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (Yukon) and will require the approval of at least 66 2/3 percent of the votes cast by InterOil shareholders at a special meeting expected to take place in September, 2016.

In addition to InterOil shareholder and court approvals, the ExxonMobil Transaction is also subject to other customary conditions. Subject to obtaining the aforementioned approvals and satisfaction of closing conditions, the ExxonMobil Transaction is expected to close in September, 2016.

Further information regarding the transaction with ExxonMobil will be included in an information circular, which will be mailed to InterOil shareholders in due course. Copies of the key transaction documents for the ExxonMobil Transaction (being the arrangement agreement and the information circular) will be available online under InterOil’s corporate profile at www.sedar.com.

Oil Search Transaction

The InterOil board of directors, in consultation with its independent legal and financial advisors, determined that the ExxonMobil Transaction is superior to the previously announced transaction with Oil Search Limited (ASX:OSH, POMSoX: OSH) and so advised Oil Search on July 18, 2016. Immediately prior to entering into the arrangement agreement with ExxonMobil, InterOil terminated its previously announced arrangement agreement with Oil Search, and ExxonMobil is paying Oil Search the termination fee in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Search arrangement agreement on behalf of InterOil. The previously scheduled Special Meeting of Shareholders to vote for the approval of the Oil Search transaction has been cancelled.

Advisers

Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP and Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP served as legal advisers to ExxonMobil in relation to the ExxonMobil Transaction.

Credit Suisse (Australia) Limited, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and UBS served as financial advisers to InterOil in relation to the ExxonMobil Transaction, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Goodmans served as its legal advisers. Morgan Stanley & Co.

     LONDON -- An investment firm formed by former executives of Deutsche Bank
AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has agreed to buy CIFC LLC, a publicly
traded credit-fund manager based in New York, for about $330 million in
cash, according to people familiar with the matter.
     The acquisition by newly formed F.A.B. Partners is expected to be
announced as soon as later Friday, the people said.
     CIFC, with a market value of about $160 million, specializes in
collateralized loan portfolios and is majority-owned by Columbus Nova, the
U.S. investment arm of the Renova Group, a Russian conglomerate. CIFC
manages about $14 billion in debt investments.
     The acquisition is the first deal by Jersey-based F.A.B. Partners, which
was set up in recent months by former Deutsche Bank executives Michele
Faissola and Nizar Al-Bassam, along with Dalinc Ariburnu, who most recently
was at Goldman Sachs.
     F.A.B. is backed in the transaction by Supreme Universal Holdings Ltd.,
an investment arm of the Qatari royal family, people familiar with the
matter said.
     F.A.B. aims to source and manage investments for clients including
high-net-worth families and sovereign-wealth funds, according to the
company's website. It has about a dozen clients, including the Qatari royal
family, one of the people said.
     Mr. Faissola left Deutsche Bank last year after overseeing its

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161031005488/en/ 

Under the terms of the agreement, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both companies, at the closing of the transaction Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share and 37.5% of the new company. GE will own 62.5% of the company. The transaction is expected to close in mid 2017. 

“This transaction creates an industry leader, one that is ideally positioned to grow in any market. Oil & gas customers demand more productive solutions. This can only be achieved through technical innovation and service execution, the hallmarks of GE and Baker Hughes,” said Jeff Immelt, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GE. “As we built the GE Oil & Gas business, I have always been impressed by the respect our customers have for Baker Hughes. GE Oil & Gas is a key GE business, one that fully leverages the GE Store. As we go forward, this transaction accelerates our capability to extend the digital framework to the oil and gas industry. An oilfield service platform is essential to deliver digitally enabled offerings to our customers. We expect Predix to become an industry standard and synonymous with improved customer outcomes. GE investors will benefit through ownership of a stronger business with substantial synergies and an improved competitive position. The transaction is expected to add approximately $.04 to GE EPS in 2018, $.08 by 2020.” 

Martin Craighead, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at Baker Hughes said, “This compelling combination brings together best-in-class oilfield equipment manufacturing and services, and digital technology offerings for the benefit of all customers and stakeholders. The combination of our complementary assets will create a platform capable of seamless integration while we enhance our ability to deliver optimized and integrated solutions and increase touch points with our customers. In addition, Baker Hughes shareholders will receive a special one-time cash dividend of $17.50 per share and benefit from the upside of a stronger, larger business. With employees of Baker Hughes and GE Oil & Gas coming together, the new company will be an industry leader, well-positioned to compete in the oil and gas industry while pushing the boundaries of innovation for our customers.” 

Lorenzo Simonelli, who is currently president and CEO of GE Oil & Gas said, “This transformative transaction will create a powerful force in the oil and gas market as we continue to drive long-term value for our customers and shareholders. This transaction is also exciting for employees of both companies. GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes are an exceptional cultural fit, sharing a commitment to exceeding customer expectations. Both companies’ employees will benefit significantly from being part of a larger, stronger company that is positioned for long-term growth. We look forward to combining the digital solutions and technology from the GE Store with the domain expertise of Baker Hughes and its culture of innovation in the oilfield services sector.” 

Compelling Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Transaction 

Complementary assets and integrated offerings will provide differentiated services for combined company’s customers. The company will combine the digital solutions, manufacturing expertise and technology from the GE Store and the outstanding track record of success Baker Hughes has in the oilfield services sector. With combined revenue of over $32 billion1 the product portfolio of GE Oil & Gas and Baker Hughes in drilling, completions, production and midstream / downstream equipment and services will create the second largest player in the oilfield equipment and services industry. Customers should expect sustainable innovation and integration that will deliver valuable outcomes. As one company, we will have operations in more than 120 countries. Both companies have invested even in the downturn and have strong, complementary competitive scope across the industry. From GE’s fullstream oil and gas manufacturing and technology solutions spanning across subsea & drilling, rotating equipment, imaging and sensing to the Baker Hughes portfolio in Drilling & Evaluation and Completion & Production, the combined company will be moving beyond oilfield services and into oil and gas productivity solutions. 
The combination produces substantial synergies through combined efficiency and growth. The companies expect to generate total runrate synergies of $1.6 billion by 2020, which has a net present value of $14 billion. While this is primarily driven by cost out, we believe that the new company is positioned for growth as the industry rebounds. 
Combination positioned to create value for Baker Hughes shareholders. The diversified portfolio can deliver through the oil and gas cycle. There is a large pool of synergies that will improve operating margins and drive organic growth. The “New” Baker Hughes has a strong balance sheet. 
Combination positioned to create value for GE shareholders. The transaction is expected to be accretive to GE’s earnings per share by $.04 by 2018 and $.08 by 2020. This is another step in creating the premium digital industrial company. 
The “New” Baker Hughes is expected to be the partner and employer of choice for the industry. Combination is an exceptional cultural fit. Both companies’ employees will benefit significantly from being part of a larger, more diversified company.

TransDigm and Breeze-Eastern both design, manufacture and supply highly engineered aircraft components.

Under the terms of the agreement, a subsidiary of TransDigm will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Breeze-Eastern common stock for $19.61 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $206 million. Following the purchase of shares through the tender offer, TransDigm will complete the transaction by acquiring all remaining shares not acquired in the offer through a merger at the same price as the tender offer.  The transaction will be funded with TransDigm's cash on hand and is not subject to any financing condition. The merger agreement was unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of Breeze-Eastern.

W. Nicholas Howley, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of TransDigm, stated, ""Breeze-Eastern pioneered the technology for helicopter rescue hoists and cargo winches and subsequently became a leading global designer and manufacturer of highly engineered, proprietary rescue hoists, winches and cargo hooks, as well as weapons-handling systems equipment, which currently can be found on all types of military and civilian aircraft.  Major customers include Sikorsky, Boeing, AgustaWestland, Airbus and the U.S. Government, serving such platforms as the UH-60 Blackhawk, CH-47 Chinook, Airbus A400M transport, HH-65 Dolphin and AW-139 series helicopter. About 75% of Breeze-Eastern's total revenue is derived from military markets and 70% from aftermarket products, with the vast majority being from proprietary products. We are pleased to have an agreement to acquire Breeze-Eastern given that the proprietary nature of these products, along with significant aftermarket content, fits well with our overall business strategy.""

Brad Pedersen, Breeze-Eastern's President and CEO, added, ""We believe Breeze-Eastern will be an excellent addition to the TransDigm portfolio of companies, as our products, business model, strategy and focus are closely aligned.  Being part of a larger aerospace company will allow for further growth opportunities and provide resources for Breeze-Eastern to continue developing the highly engineered life-saving products that we're known for today.  On account of this, we believe the transaction positions Breeze-Eastern well for the future and is good news for Breeze-Eastern's stockholders, employees, customers and suppliers.   We are proud of our history and accomplishments and look forward to our future together with TransDigm.""

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the parties anticipate that TransDigm will commence a cash tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of Breeze-Eastern on or before December 3, 2015.  The tender offer will not be closed until conclusion of the ""go shop"" period described below.  TransDigm's obligation to accept and purchase Breeze-Eastern common stock tendered pursuant to the offer will be subject to customary closing conditions, including the valid tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Breeze-Eastern common stock and the expiration of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.  

As contemplated by the merger agreement, Breeze-Eastern, with the assistance of its independent advisors, will solicit superior proposals from third parties during the next 40 days.  Breeze-Eastern does not anticipate disclosing any developments regarding this process unless and until its Board of Directors makes a decision with respect to a potential superior proposal.  There is no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal.  TransDigm will terminate its tender offer if Breeze-Eastern accepts a superior proposal and terminates the merger agreement in accordance with its terms.

Transaction Expected to be Immediately Accretive to SXL Distributable Cash Flow 

Sunoco Logistics Partners L.P. (NYSE: SXL) and Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. (NYSE: ETP) today announced that they have entered into a merger agreement providing for the acquisition of ETP by SXL in a unit-for-unit transaction. The transaction was approved by the boards of directors and conflicts committees of both partnerships and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017, subject to receipt of ETP unitholder approval and other customary closing conditions. 

This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161121005638/en/ 

Under the terms of the transaction, ETP unitholders will receive 1.5 common units of SXL for each common unit of ETP they own. This equates to a 10% premium to the volume weighted average pricing of ETP’s common units for the last 30 trading days immediately prior to the announcement of the transaction. 

As SXL will be the acquiring entity, the existing incentive distribution rights provisions in the SXL partnership agreement will continue to be in effect, and Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. (NYSE: ETE) will own the incentive distribution rights of SXL following the closing of the transaction. As part of this transaction, ETE has agreed to continue to provide all the incentive distribution right subsidies that are currently in effect with respect to both partnerships. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to SXL’s distributable cash flow per common unit and is also expected to allow the combined partnership to be in position to achieve near-term distribution increases in the low double digits and a more than 1.0x distribution coverage ratio. 

The transaction is expected to provide significant benefits for SXL and ETP unitholders as the combined partnership will have increased scale and diversification across multiple producing basins and will have greater opportunities to more closely integrate SXL’s natural gas liquids business with ETP’s natural gas gathering, processing and transportation business. With this transaction, SXL and ETP expect to build upon their experience working together as partners in several joint ventures to pursue commercial opportunities and to achieve cost savings while enhancing the service capabilities for their customers. SXL and ETP expect that the transaction will allow for commercial synergies and costs savings in excess of $200 million annually by 2019. 

The transaction is also expected to strengthen the balance sheet of the combined organization by utilizing cash distribution savings to reduce debt and to fund a portion of the growth capital expenditure programs of the two partnerships. ETP and SXL have spent approximately $15 billion in organic growth capital over the past several years, and these expenditures, combined with the completion of other major capital projects currently in progress, are expected to continue to generate strong distributable cash flow growth. 

Both ETP and SXL management teams are pleased to be able to bring two strong partnerships together in this strategic transaction that combines the premier crude oil midstream MLP with the premier natural gas midstream MLP. The combined partnership is expected to be the second largest MLP as measured by enterprise value. 

At the closing of the transaction, the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer of the combined partnership will be Kelcy Warren, Mackie McCrea, Matt Ramsey and Tom Long, respectively, and it is expected that Mike Hennigan and other members of the SXL management team will continue in leading management roles of the combined company with the SXL business headquartered in Philadelphia. 

SXL and ETP will hold a joint conference call to discuss the transaction details on Monday, November 21, 2016 at 3:00 p.m. Central Time (4:00 p.m. Eastern Time). An investor presentation will be posted to the partnerships’ websites and filed with the SEC on a Form 8-K.

Great Plains Energy Incorporated (NYSE: GXP), the parent company of KCP&L, and Westar Energy, Inc. (NYSE: WR), today announced a definitive agreement for Great Plains Energy to acquire Westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. Upon closing, Westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.

Once the transaction is complete, Great Plains Energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. In addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility’s retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.

“Westar and KCP&L are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in Kansas. The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy and KCP&L. “This is an important transaction for Kansas and our entire region. By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”

Currently, Great Plains Energy and Westar jointly own and operate the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station, as well as the La Cygne and Jeffrey power plants. With the addition of Westar’s generation fleet, Great Plains Energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. This will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. In addition, among investor-owned utilities in the United States, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.

“This is an important day for Westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of Kansas,” said Mark Ruelle, president and chief executive officer of Westar. “Our commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with Great Plains Energy’s values, which makes them our ideal partner. We’re eager to join the Great Plains Energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.”

Great Plains Energy has an established track record of successful integration with adjacent electric utilities. In 2008, Great Plains Energy completed its acquisition of Aquila, an electric utility serving customers in adjacent areas of Missouri. That successful acquisition has delivered – and continues to deliver – significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission.

“The utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. These factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. Our acquisition of Westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved – customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. These savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,” said Bassham. “Combining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 Kansas and 600,000 Missouri customers.”

Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, Westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of Westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in Great Plains Energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the Great Plains Energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of Great Plains Energy common stock for each Westar share of common stock, representing a consideration mix of 85 percent cash and 15 percent stock.

The transaction enterprise value is expected to be approximately $12.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $8.6 billion in total stock and cash consideration to be received by Westar’s shareholders and the assumption of approximately $3.6 billion in Westar’s debt. Great Plains Energy has secured approximately $8.0 billion of committed debt financing from Goldman Sachs Bank USA and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC in connection with the transaction for the full cash portion of the transaction consideration. Great Plains Energy has also secured a $750 million mandatorily preferred convertible equity commitment from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), to be funded at the closing of the transaction. Great Plains Energy plans to issue long-term financing consisting of a combination of equity, equity-linked securities and debt prior to closing of the transaction. This financing mix will allow Great Plains Energy to maintain its solid, investment grade credit ratings.

Great Plains Energy expects savings generated from combining the two companies to be consistent with recent comparable transactions, and its own recent experience. Great Plains Energy expects the acquisition will be neutral to earnings-per-share in the first full calendar year of operations and significantly accretive thereafter. The long-term earnings growth target of the combined company is expected to grow to six to eight percent—better than either company on a standalone basis.

Leadership and headquarters

Upon completion of the transaction, Bassham will be chairman and chief executive officer of the combined company. Ruelle will remain in his current role with Westar until the closing of the transaction. In addition, Great Plains Energy will add one director from the Westar Board of Directors to the Great Plains Energy Board of Directors.

“We understand the importance of Westar to the communities it serves and the meaningful contributions it makes as a major employer in Kansas,” said Bassham. “We are committed to maintaining the operating headquarters for our Kansas service territory in downtown Topeka. We also know that Westar has a reputation as a strong supporter of community and charitable initiatives. We will continue this legacy and are committed to maintaining a strong presence in all of the communities Westar serves.”

Sustainability

Customers today expect their utility providers to identify and advance energy efficiency options that give them greater control and choice. The combined company will have a greater, more diverse portfolio of energy solutions that give customers the opportunities to better manage their individual energy needs. In addition, Great Plains Energy operates the nation’s largest utility-owned electric vehicle charging network, which can be expanded to benefit Westar’s customers.

Regulatory Approval

The companies anticipate making the required regulatory filings with the Kansas Corporation Commission and other regulatory entities during June and July of 2016. In addition, Great Plains Energy and Westar will seek shareholder approvals later this year. The transaction is subject to approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The transaction also is subject to the notification, clearance and reporting requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act by the Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice. The companies anticipate closing in the spring of 2017. In the coming months, the companies will work together to develop a robust integration plan.

(NYSE: WR), today announced a definitive agreement for Great Plains Energy to acquire Westar in a combined cash and stock transaction with an enterprise value of approximately $12.2 billion, including total equity value of approximately $8.6 billion. Upon closing, Westar will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy.  Once the transaction is complete, Great Plains Energy will have more than 1.5 million customers in Kansas and Missouri, nearly 13,000 megawatts of generation capacity, almost 10,000 miles of transmission lines and over 51,000 miles of distribution lines. In addition, more than 45 percent of the combined utility’s retail customer demand can be met with emission-free energy.  “Westar and KCP&L are trusted neighbors and have worked together for generations in Kansas. The combination of our two companies is the best fit for meeting our region’s energy needs,” said Terry Bassham, chairman and chief executive officer of Great Plains Energy and KCP&L. “This is an important transaction for Kansas and our entire region. By combining our two companies, we are keeping ownership local and management responsive to regulators, customers and regional needs, while enhancing our ability to build long-term value for shareholders.”  Currently, Great Plains Energy and Westar jointly own and operate the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station, as well as the La Cygne and Jeffrey power plants. With the addition of Westar’s generation fleet, Great Plains Energy will have a more diverse and sustainable generation portfolio. This will provide increased flexibility to mitigate the potential customer impacts from future carbon regulation. In addition, among investor-owned utilities in the United States, the combined company will have one of the largest portfolios of wind generation in the country.  “This is an important day for Westar, our customers, employees, shareholders, the communities we support and for the state of Kansas,” said Mark Ruelle, president and chief executive officer of Westar. “Our commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction, safety and sustainability is consistent with Great Plains Energy’s values, which makes them our ideal partner. We’re eager to join the Great Plains Energy team, and excited about this new chapter that combines the unique strengths of our respective organizations to form an even stronger company for our state.”  Great Plains Energy has an established track record of successful integration with adjacent electric utilities. In 2008, Great Plains Energy completed its acquisition of Aquila, an electric utility serving customers in adjacent areas of Missouri. That successful acquisition has delivered – and continues to deliver – significant savings for customers, which exceeded initial expectations and was reviewed and approved by both the Missouri Public Service Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission.  “The utility industry is facing rising customer expectations, increasing environmental standards and emerging cyber security threats. These factors, coupled with slower demand growth for electricity, are driving our costs and customer rates higher. Our acquisition of Westar will create operational efficiencies and future cost savings that will benefit all involved – customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. These savings also will help reduce future rate increase requests,” said Bassham. “Combining our two companies will result in cost savings and operational benefits for our more than 900,000 Kansas and 600,000 Missouri customers.”  Transaction terms and financing profile  Under the terms of the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the boards of directors for both companies, Westar shareholders will receive $60.00 per share of total consideration for each share of Westar common stock, consisting of $51.00 in cash and $9.00 in Great Plains Energy common stock, subject to a 7.5 percent collar based upon the Great Plains Energy common stock price at the time of the closing of the transaction, with the exchange ratio for the stock consideration ranging between 0.2709 to 0.3148 shares of Great Plains Energy common stock for each Westar share of common stock, representing a consideration mix of 85 percent cash and 15 percent stock.  The transaction enterprise value is expected to be approximately $12.2 billion, inclusive of approximately $8.6 billion in total stock and cash consideration to be received by Westar’s shareholders and the assumption of approximately $3.6 billion in Westar’s debt.

Great Plains Energy has also secured a $750 million mandatorily preferred convertible equity commitment from the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS), to be funded at the closing of the transaction.

Combination of ADT and Protection 1
  Acquisition Represents Premium of 56% Over Closing Stock Price
  CHICAGO, NEW YORK and BOCA RATON, Fla., Feb. 16, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) --
The ADT Corporation (NYSE:ADT) (""ADT""), a leading provider of monitored
security, interactive home and business automation and related monitoring
services in the United States and Canada, today announced that it has
entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by an affiliate of
certain funds (the ""Apollo Funds"") managed by affiliates of Apollo Global
Management, LLC (NYSE:APO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,
""Apollo"") and co-investors and merged with a subsidiary of Prime Security
Services Borrower, LLC (with its subsidiaries, ""Protection 1""), a leading
full-service business and home security company in the United States also
owned by the Apollo Funds, for $42.00 per share in cash. The purchase price
represents a premium of approximately 56% over ADT's closing share price on
February 12, 2016 and, when combined with Protection 1, represents an
aggregate transaction value of approximately $15 billion. The headquarters
of the combined company will remain in Boca Raton, FL, and the combined
company will operate primarily under the ADT brand.
  ""This transaction represents a highly attractive premium for ADT's
shareholders,"" said Naren Gursahaney, President and CEO of ADT.  ""We're
proud to have strengthened the quality of our customer base, improved
service and retention, and extended our leadership in innovative solutions
such as our ADT Pulse platform and our new Security-as-a-Service offering,
ADT Canopy. By combining Protection 1 with ADT, we will be better positioned
to expand the breadth and depth of the services we offer to our customers
throughout the United States and Canada.""
  ""The combined company will be a market leader with a powerful brand and
scale resulting in an enhanced overall customer experience,"" said Timothy J.
Whall, President and CEO of Protection 1, who will be the CEO of the
combined business following the closing of the transaction.  ""In addition,
Protection 1's robust commercial presence will speed ADT's expansion into
the commercial sector supported by increasing commercial sales and technical
skills across a well matched national footprint.""
  ""We are tremendously excited by this unique opportunity to combine two
premier businesses,"" said Marc Becker, Senior Partner at Apollo. ""This
transaction provides the opportunity to dramatically enhance our position in
the large, fragmented and growing residential and business interactive
electronic monitoring industry.  Pro forma for the transaction, the newly
created company will generate a combined $318 million in recurring monthly
revenue and total annual revenue in excess of $4.2 billion, placing the
businesses in a strong position to drive innovation and to capitalize on
growth opportunities in the future.""
  The Board of Directors of ADT unanimously approved the transaction. The
acquisition of ADT is expected to be completed by June 2016. The transaction
is subject to the conclusion of the applicable antitrust waiting periods in
the United States and Canada, ADT stockholder approval and other customary
closing conditions.
  The merger agreement includes a ""go-shop"" period, during which ADT and its
Board of Directors may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially
enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals during
a 40-day period following the execution date of the definitive agreement.
There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior
proposal. ADT does not intend to disclose developments about this process
unless and until its Board has made a decision with respect to any potential
superior proposal.
  The transaction, which has fully committed financing in place, will be
financed primarily through the incurrence of $1.555 billion in new first
lien term loans, $3.140 billion in new second lien financing, the issuance
of $750 million of preferred securities to an affiliate of Koch Equity
Development LLC, the investment and acquisition subsidiary of Koch
Industries, Inc., and an equity contribution of approximately $4.5 billion
from funds managed by Apollo and co-investors.  Protection 1 will also enter
into a new $255 million first lien revolving facility concurrently with the
closing of the merger, bringing the total combined senior secured revolving
facility to $350 million.  Protection 1 further expects that its existing
$1,095 million first lien term loan and $260 million second lien term loan
will remain outstanding. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the
merger, Protection 1 intends to redeem all of ADT's outstanding senior
unsecured 2.250% notes due July 2017 and senior unsecured 4.125% notes due
April 2019, which will be redeemed in accordance with the applicable
indenture, and to repay all outstanding borrowings under ADT's revolving
credit facility.  Finally, ADT's remaining $3.750 billion of total senior
unsecured notes will be guaranteed by Protection 1 and all wholly owned
domestic subsidiaries of the combined company and will be secured by first
priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the issuer
and the guarantors.  As a result, Protection 1 expects that these notes will
maintain their current ratings and remain outstanding.
  Financing is being provided by Barclays, Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Deutsche Bank and Royal Bank of Canada.  PSP Investments Credit USA LLC is
also a committed lender under this debt financing.  Goldman, Sachs is
serving as lead financial advisor to ADT and BofA Merrill Lynch is also

The purchase price represents a premium of approximately 56% over ADT's closing share price on February 12, 2016 and, when combined with Protection 1, represents an aggregate transaction value of approximately $15 billion. The headquarters of the combined company will remain in Boca Raton, FL, and the combined company will operate primarily under the ADT brand.   ""This transaction represents a highly attractive premium for ADT's shareholders,"" said Naren Gursahaney, President and CEO of ADT.

The acquisition of ADT is expected to be completed by June 2016. The transaction is subject to the conclusion of the applicable antitrust waiting periods in the United States and Canada, ADT stockholder approval and other customary closing conditions.   The merger agreement includes a ""go-shop"" period, during which ADT and its Board of Directors may actively solicit, receive, evaluate and potentially enter into negotiations with parties that offer alternative proposals during a 40-day period following the execution date of the definitive agreement. There can be no assurance that this process will result in a superior proposal. ADT does not intend to disclose developments about this process unless and until its Board has made a decision with respect to any potential superior proposal.   The transaction, which has fully committed financing in place, will be financed primarily through the incurrence of $1.555 billion in new first lien term loans, $3.140 billion in new second lien financing, the issuance of $750 million of preferred securities to an affiliate of Koch Equity Development LLC, the investment and acquisition subsidiary of Koch Industries, Inc., and an equity contribution of approximately $4.5 billion from funds managed by Apollo and co-investors.  Protection 1 will also enter into a new $255 million first lien revolving facility concurrently with the closing of the merger, bringing the total combined senior secured revolving facility to $350 million.  Protection 1 further expects that its existing $1,095 million first lien term loan and $260 million second lien term loan will remain outstanding. In addition, concurrently with the closing of the merger, Protection 1 intends to redeem all of ADT's outstanding senior unsecured 2.250% notes due July 2017 and senior unsecured 4.125% notes due April 2019, which will be redeemed in accordance with the applicable indenture, and to repay all outstanding borrowings under ADT's revolving credit facility.  Finally, ADT's remaining $3.750 billion of total senior unsecured notes will be guaranteed by Protection 1 and all wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of the combined company and will be secured by first priority security interests in substantially all of the assets of the issuer and the guarantors.

Greater Potential to Enhance Shareholder Returns Through Overlay of Investment Management Economics across a Larger Balance Sheet 

NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), Colony Capital, Inc. (“Colony”) (NYSE: CLNY) and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. (NYSE: NRF) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create a world-class, internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Special Committees of NSAM and NRF, and the Board of Directors of Colony. The combined company will be named “Colony NorthStar, Inc.” 

Upon completion of the transaction, terms of which are detailed below, NSAM shareholders will own approximately 32.85%, Colony shareholders will own approximately 33.25% and NRF shareholders will own approximately 33.90% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. NSAM shareholders will also receive, in addition to its regular quarterly dividend, a special cash dividend equal to $128 million, which represents a one-time distribution of excess NSAM taxable earnings and profits. 

Upon closing of the transaction, Thomas J. Barrack Jr. will be Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of Colony NorthStar, David Hamamoto will be Executive Vice Chairman, and Richard B. Saltzman will be Chief Executive Officer. 

David Hamamoto, Executive Chairman of NSAM and Chairman of NRF, stated, “We are incredibly excited to merge with Colony to create a global real estate leader well positioned for long-term growth. This strategic combination is the next logical step for NSAM and NRF, creating substantial value for shareholders and transforming the companies into a world-class, internally-managed equity REIT that includes a sizable, established institutional and retail asset management platform. We are confident that Colony NorthStar with its lower leverage, larger balance sheet and improved liquidity profile is poised for meaningful multiple expansion and substantially enhanced long-term returns for shareholders.” 

Thomas J. Barrack, Jr., Executive Chairman of Colony, stated, “This is an amazing combination of three highly compatible companies with complementary strategic priorities that we expect will deliver substantial value for all three sets of shareholders. The combined company will have both the capability and balance sheet capacity to deploy capital to establish and fortify foundational equity real estate positions through all points in the cycle, across geographies, asset types and capital structures. We also will realize substantial efficiencies and synergies by bringing our organizations together and offering a well curated menu of durable real estate business lines with broad-based capital access.” 

“The pro forma combined enterprise’s enhanced scale, diversification, and unique platforms will foster the ability to generate substantial return on equity through high quality real estate investments enhanced by attractive investment management revenues,” said Richard B. Saltzman, Chief Executive Officer and President of Colony. “In addition, the merger produces an outstanding partnership of complementary management talent with access to enormous capital and distribution resources for the benefit of our shareholders.” 

Transaction Delivers a Number of Strategic and Financial Benefits 

Creates World-Class Real Estate and Investment Management Platform: Global, diversified equity REIT with $58 billion of assets under management, led by a seasoned management team with access to proprietary deal sourcing and a significant track record as a global investor, operator and asset manager. 
Larger, More Diversified and Stable Investment Portfolio: Well-diversified portfolio of investments with concentration in scaled verticals across geographies, property types and capital stack positions, consisting primarily of owned real estate. 
Significant Cost Savings: Approximately $115 million in total annual cost synergies, consisting of approximately $80 million of cash savings and approximately $35 million of stock based compensation savings, expected to be realized post-closing. 
Stronger Balance Sheet, Ongoing Deleveraging and Improved Liquidity: Asset monetization and sale initiatives by NRF, totaling approximately $1.5 billion in projected net proceeds, are expected to bring the total debt-to-capitalization ratio of the combined company under 50%, while continuing with an objective of upgrading the credit profile of the combined company and lowering the overall cost of capital. 
Increased Scale and Value Creation: Colony NorthStar is expected to be in the top quartile ranked by equity market capitalization, according to the MSCI U.S. REIT Index (RMZ) classification, with a broad platform that expands its ability to deploy third-party fee-bearing capital to accelerate growth and provide enhanced returns to shareholders from consistent, longer duration fee related income. 
Widens Access to Multiple Sources of Capital: Unmatched access to global investors targeting real estate investment through public vehicles, private institutional and retail capital platforms. 
Transaction Structure 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, NSAM will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as an REIT beginning in 2017, and NRF and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc. NSAM shareholders will continue to own one (1) share of Colony NorthStar common stock for each share of NSAM common stock they previously owned. Colony common shareholders will receive 1.4663 shares of Colony NorthStar’s common stock for each share of Colony common stock they own, and NRF common shareholders will receive 1.0996 shares of Colony NorthStar’s common stock for each share of NRF common stock they own. Each of Colony and NRF has preferred stock outstanding and the holders of such preferred stock will receive shares of preferred stock of Colony NorthStar that are substantially similar to the preferred stock held prior to the closing of the transaction. 

Certain NSAM and NRF executives have entered into agreements to vote their shares in favor of the transaction, and certain Colony executives, who collectively own approximately 16% of Colony’s outstanding common stock, have entered into agreements to vote their shares in favor of the transaction. 

Management and Governance 

Colony NorthStar’s board will consist of 13 directors in total – six nominated by NSAM and NRF, six nominated by Colony and one additional board member to be mutually agreed upon by the existing NSAM, Colony and NRF directors. The majority of the board will be comprised of independent directors. In addition to the roles outlined above for Messrs. Barrack, Hamamoto and Saltzman, Darren Tangen will be Chief Financial Officer and Mark Hedstrom will be Chief Operating Officer of the combined company. Al Tylis, NSAM’s Chief Executive Officer and a member of the NSAM and NRF Board of Directors, has agreed to assist in the transition following the merger. Dan Gilbert, NSAM and NRF's Chief Investment and Operating Officer will, among other responsibilities, continue to oversee Colony NorthStar’s retail platform. 

Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert have agreed to reduce the cash severance payments and performance-based equity awards that would have been contractually owed to them upon consummation of the transaction by approximately (i) $52 million of cash payments and (ii) 2.6 million shares of performance-based equity awards which would have been earned based on current stock prices at the consummation of the transaction. Additionally, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert will forfeit performance-based awards with respect to approximately 1.2 million shares of NSAM common stock and 740,000 shares of NRF common stock as a result of the transaction. Furthermore, in lieu of any remaining cash severance payments resulting from the transaction that these executives would have been entitled to receive, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert will receive equity in Colony NorthStar, which will be subject to vesting based on continued employment with Colony NorthStar for one-year following the closing of the transaction, and with respect to Messrs. Hamamoto and Gilbert, will be subject to a two-year lock-up following the closing of the transaction. The number of such shares, in lieu of the remaining $106 million cash severance payments, will be determined based on the five day volume weighted average trading price of the shares of common stock of Colony NorthStar following the merger. Based on the June 2, 2016 closing price of NSAM, this would equate to approximately 8.6 million shares, or approximately 1.4%, of Colony NorthStar common stock, subject to the restrictions referred to above. Similarly, the number of remaining performance-based equity awards contractually owed to each of Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert upon consummation of the transaction is approximately 2.5 million shares, or approximately 0.4%, of Colony NorthStar common stock. Additionally, Messrs. Hamamoto, Tylis and Gilbert have each agreed to a base salary of $1 for 2017 and have also agreed to forego a 2017 bonus. 

Approvals and Anticipated Closing 

The transaction is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals, and approval by the NSAM, Colony and NRF shareholders.

and Los Angeles Times publisher Tronc Inc., ending a monthslong pursuit of
its rival.
     In a one-line statement Tuesday, Gannett said it had been engaged in
discussions with Tronc but determined not to pursue the transaction any
longer.
     Gannett's stock rose 9.4% to $8.50 premarket as Tronc fell 29% to $8.51,
well below Gannett's initial takeover offer of $12.25 a share in cash, which
had since been boosted.
     The news that a deal is off comes after The Wall Street Journal reported
in August that Gannett had privately sweetened its bid for Tronc, which in
May rejected a boosted $15 a share offer. Gannett first made a bid for Tronc
in April, when it was then called Tribune Publishing.
     A transaction would have been the latest amid a flurry of newspaper
deals. Gannett has been seeking to build scale in a newspaper industry
suffering from steep declines in advertising revenue. A combined company
would have joined titles such as Gannett's USA Today with the Chicago
Tribune and Los Angeles Times.","     Newspaper company Gannett Co. has dropped its bid to buy Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times publisher Tronc Inc., ending a monthslong pursuit of its rival.      In a one-line statement Tuesday, Gannett said it had been engaged in discussions with Tronc but determined not to pursue the transaction any longer.      Gannett's stock rose 9.4% to $8.50 premarket as Tronc fell 29% to $8.51, well below Gannett's initial takeover offer of $12.25 a share in cash, which had since been boosted.      The news that a deal is off comes after The Wall Street Journal reported in August that Gannett had privately sweetened its bid for Tronc, which in May rejected a boosted $15 a share offer.

","Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s talks to sell a stomach-drug
business to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for roughly $10 billion have
broken down amid last-minute disagreements over price and other matters,
according to people familiar with the matter.
     Though the talks could still be revived, Valeant is now focused on
building the business, Salix Pharmaceuticals, rather than selling it, the
people said.
     The development represents another setback for a company that's been
plagued by an accounting scandal, the departure of its top executives and a
plummeting share price. As of Tuesday's close, Valeant shares had fallen 80%
in the past year.
     Valeant is now moving ahead with plans to build the sales force for
Salix's crown jewel, the Xifaxan irritable-bowel drug. Valeant announced the
""significant"" expansion in a news release Tuesday.","Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.'s talks to sell a stomach-drug business to Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. for roughly $10 billion have broken down amid last-minute disagreements over price and other matters, according to people familiar with the matter.      Though the talks could still be revived, Valeant is now focused on building the business, Salix Pharmaceuticals, rather than selling it, the people said.      The development represents another setback for a company that's been plagued by an accounting scandal, the departure of its top executives and a plummeting share price.
